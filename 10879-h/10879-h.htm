<h2>JOHN QUINCY ADAMS</h2>
<br>

<p>John Quincy Adams, sixth President of the United States,
eldest son of John Adams, second President, was born at
Braintree, Mass., July 11, 1767. He enjoyed peculiar and rare
advantages for education. In childhood he was instructed by his
mother, a granddaughter of Colonel John Quincy, and a woman of
superior talents. In 1778, when only 11 years old, he accompanied
his father to France; attended a school in Paris, and returned
home in August, 1779. Having been taken again to Europe by his
father in 1780, he pursued his studies at the University of
Leyden, where he learned Latin and Greek. In July, 1781, at the
age of 14, he was appointed private secretary to Francis Dana,
minister to Russia. He remained at St. Petersburg until October,
1782, after which he resumed his studies at The Hague. Was
present at the signing of the definitive treaty of peace in
Paris, September 3, 1783. He passed some months with his father
in London, and returned to the United States to complete his
education, entering Harvard College in 1786 and graduating in
1788. He studied law with the celebrated Theophilus Parsons, of
Newburyport; was admitted to the bar in 1791, and began to
practice in Boston. In 1791 he published in the Boston Centinel,
under the signature of "Publicola," a series of able essays, in
which he exposed the fallacies and vagaries of the French
political reformers. These papers attracted much attention in
Europe and the United States. Under the signature of "Marcellus"
he wrote, in 1793, several articles, in which he argued that the
United States should observe strict neutrality in the war between
the French and the British. These writings commended him to the
favor of Washington, and he was appointed minister to Holland in
May, 1794. In July, 1797, he married Louisa Catherine Johnson, a
daughter of Joshua Johnson, of Maryland, who was then American
consul at London. In a letter dated February 20, 1797, Washington
commended him highly to the elder Adams, and advised the
President elect not to withhold promotion from him because he was
his son. He was accordingly appointed minister to Berlin in 1797.
He negotiated a treaty of amity and commerce with the Prussian
Government, and was recalled about February, 1801. He was elected
a Senator of the United States by the Federalists of
Massachusetts for the term beginning March, 1803. In 1805 he was
appointed professor of rhetoric and belles-lettres at Harvard
College, and accepted on condition that he should be permitted to
attend to his Senatorial duties. He offended the Federalists by
supporting Jefferson's embargo act, which was passed in December,
1807, and thus became connected with the Democratic party. He
resigned his seat in the Senate in March, 1808, declining to
serve for the remainder of the term rather than obey the
instructions of the Federalists. In March, 1809, he was appointed
by President Madison minister to Russia. During his residence in
that country he was nominated to be an associate justice of the
Supreme Court of the United States, and confirmed February, 1811;
but he declined the appointment. In 1813 Adams, Bayard, Clay,
Russell, and Gallatin were appointed commissioners to negotiate a
treaty of peace with Great Britain. They met the British
diplomatists at Ghent, and after a protracted negotiation of six
months signed a treaty of peace December 24, 1814. In the spring
of 1815 he was appointed minister to the Court of St. James,
remaining there until he was appointed by Mr. Monroe Secretary of
State in 1817. In 1824 Adams, Jackson, Crawford, and Clay were
candidates for the Presidency. Neither of the candidates having
received a majority in the electoral colleges, the election
devolved on the House of Representatives. Aided by the influence
of Henry Clay, Mr. Adams received the votes of thirteen States,
and was elected. He was defeated for reelection in 1828 by
General Andrew Jackson. On the 4th of March, 1829, he retired to
his estate at Quincy. In 1830 he was elected to Congress, and
took his seat in December, 1831. He continued to represent his
native district for seventeen years, during which time he was
constantly at his post. On the 21st of February, 1848, while in
his seat at the Capitol, he was stricken with paralysis, and died
on the 23d of that month. He was buried at Quincy, Mass.</p>

<h2>NOTIFICATION OF ELECTION.</h2>
<br>

<p>Mr. Webster, from the committee appointed for that purpose
yesterday, reported that the committee had waited on John Quincy
Adams, of Massachusetts, and had notified him that in the recent
election of a President of the United States, no person having
received a majority of the votes of all the electors appointed,
and the choice having consequently devolved upon the House of
Representatives, that House, proceeding in the manner prescribed
by the Constitution, did yesterday choose him to be President of
the United States for four years, commencing on the 4th day of
March next, and that the committee had received a written answer,
which he presented to the House. Mr. Webster also reported that
in further performance of its duty the committee had given the
information of this election to the President.</p>

<h2>Reply of the President Elect.</h2>
<p><br>
 Washington,<br>
 <i>February 10, 1825</i>.</p>
<p>Gentlemen:</p>
<p>In receiving this testimonial from the Representatives of the
people and States of this Union I am deeply sensible to the
circumstances under which it has been given. All my predecessors
in the high station to which the favor of the House now calls me
have been honored with majorities of the electoral voices in
their primary colleges. It has been my fortune to be placed by
the divisions of sentiment prevailing among our countrymen on
this occasion in competition, friendly and honorable, with three
of my fellow-citizens, all justly enjoying in eminent degrees the
public favor, and of whose worth, talents, and services no one
entertains a higher and more respectful sense than myself. The
names of two of them were, in the fulfillment of the provisions
of the Constitution, presented to the selection of the House in
concurrence with my own-names closely associated with the glory
of the nation, and one of them further recommended by a larger
minority of the primary electoral suffrages than mine.</p>
<p>In this state of things, could my refusal to accept the trust
thus delegated to me give an immediate opportunity to the people
to form and to express with a nearer approach to unanimity the
object of their preference, I should not hesitate to decline the
acceptance of this eminent charge and to submit the decision of
this momentous question again to their determination. But the
Constitution itself has not so disposed of the contingency which
would arise in the event of my refusal. I shall therefore repair
to the post assigned me by the call of my country, signified
through her constitutional organs, oppressed with the magnitude
of the task before me, but cheered with the hope of that generous
support from my fellow-citizens which, in the vicissitudes of a
life devoted to their service, has never failed to sustain me,
confident in the trust that the wisdom of the legislative
councils will guide and direct me in the path of my official
duty, and relying above all upon the superintending providence of
that Being in whose hands our breath is and whose are all our
ways.</p>
<p>Gentlemen, I pray you to make acceptable to the House the
assurance of my profound gratitude for their confidence, and to
accept yourselves my thanks for the friendly terms in which you
have communicated to me their decision.</p>
<p>John Quincy Adams.</p>

<h2>Letter from the President Elect.</h2>
<p><br>
 City of Washington,<br>
 <i>March 1, 1825</i></p>
<p>The President of the Senate of the United States.</p>
<p>Sir:</p>
<p>I ask the favor of you to inform the honorable Senate of the
United States that I propose to take the oath prescribed by the
Constitution to the President of the United States before he
enters on the execution of his office, on Friday, the 4th
instant, at 12 o'clock, in the Hall of the House of
Representatives.</p>
<p>I have the honor to be, with the highest respect, sir, your
very humble and obedient servant,</p>
<p>John Quincy Adams.</p>

<br>
<h2>INAUGURAL ADDRESS.</h2>
<br>
<p>In compliance with an usage coeval with the existence of our
Federal Constitution, and sanctioned by the example of my
predecessors in the career upon which I am about to enter, I
appear, my fellow-citizens, in your presence and in that of
Heaven to bind myself by the solemnities of religious obligation
to the faithful performance of the duties allotted to me in the
station to which I have been called.</p>
<p>In unfolding to my countrymen the principles by which I shall
be governed in the fulfillment of those duties my first resort
will be to that Constitution which I shall swear to the best of
my ability to preserve, protect, and defend. That revered
instrument enumerates the powers and prescribes the duties of the
Executive Magistrate, and in its first words declares the
purposes to which these and the whole action of the Government
instituted by it should be invariably and sacredly devoted-to
form a more perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic
tranquillity, provide for the common defense, promote the general
welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to the people of
this Union in their successive generations. Since the adoption of
this social compact one of these generations has passed away. It
is the work of our forefathers. Administered by some of the most
eminent men who contributed to its formation, through a most
eventful period in the annals of the world, and through all the
vicissitudes of peace and war incidental to the condition of
associated man, it has not disappointed the hopes and aspirations
of those illustrious benefactors of their age and nation. It has
promoted the lasting welfare of that country so dear to us all;
it has to an extent far beyond the ordinary lot of humanity
secured the freedom and happiness of this people. We now receive
it as a precious inheritance from those to whom we are indebted
for its establishment, doubly bound by the examples which they
have left us and by the blessings which we have enjoyed as the
fruits of their labors to transmit the same unimpaired to the
succeeding generation.</p>
<p>In the compass of thirty-six years since this great national
covenant was instituted a body of laws enacted under its
authority and in conformity with its provisions has unfolded its
powers and carried into practical operation its effective
energies. Subordinate departments have distributed the executive
functions in their various relations to foreign affairs, to the
revenue and expenditures, and to the military force of the Union
by land and sea. A coordinate department of the judiciary has
expounded the Constitution and the laws, settling in harmonious
coincidence with the legislative will numerous weighty questions
of construction which the imperfection of human language had
rendered unavoidable. The year of jubilee since the first
formation of our Union has just elapsed; that of the declaration
of our independence is at hand. The consummation of both was
effected by this Constitution.</p>
<p>Since that period a population of four millions has multiplied
to twelve. A territory bounded by the Mississippi has been
extended from sea to sea. New States have been admitted to the
Union in numbers nearly equal to those of the first
Confederation. Treaties of peace, amity, and commerce have been
concluded with the principal dominions of the earth. The people
of other nations, inhabitants of regions acquired not by
conquest, but by compact, have been united with us in the
participation of our rights and duties, of our burdens and
blessings. The forest has fallen by the ax of our woodsmen; the
soil has been made to teem by the tillage of our farmers; our
commerce has whitened every ocean. The dominion of man over
physical nature has been extended by the invention of our
artists. Liberty and law have marched hand in hand. All the
purposes of human association have been accomplished as
effectively as under any other government on the globe, and at a
cost little exceeding in a whole generation the expenditure of
other nations in a single year.</p>
<p>Such is the unexaggerated picture of our condition under a
Constitution founded upon the republican principle of equal
rights. To admit that this picture has its shades is but to say
that it is still the condition of men upon earth. From
evil-physical, moral, and political-it is not our claim to be
exempt. We have suffered sometimes by the visitation of Heaven
through disease; often by the wrongs and injustice of other
nations, even to the extremities of war; and, lastly, by
dissensions among ourselves-dissensions perhaps inseparable from
the enjoyment of freedom, but which have more than once appeared
to threaten the dissolution of the Union, and with it the
overthrow of all the enjoyments of our present lot and all our
earthly hopes of the future. The causes of these dissensions have
been various, founded upon differences of speculation in the
theory of republican government; upon conflicting views of policy
in our relations with foreign nations; upon jealousies of partial
and sectional interests, aggravated by prejudices and
prepossessions which strangers to each other are ever apt to
entertain.</p>
<p>It is a source of gratification and of encouragement to me to
observe that the great result of this experiment upon the theory
of human rights has at the close of that generation by which it
was formed been crowned with success equal to the most sanguine
expectations of its founders. Union, justice, tranquillity, the
common defense, the general welfare, and the blessings of
liberty-all have been promoted by the Government under which we
have lived. Standing at this point of time, looking back to that
generation which has gone by and forward to that which is
advancing, we may at once indulge in grateful exultation and in
cheering hope. From the experience of the past we derive
instructive lessons for the future. Of the two great political
parties which have divided the opinions and feelings of our
country, the candid and the just will now admit that both have
contributed splendid talents, spotless integrity, ardent
patriotism, and disinterested sacrifices to the formation and
administration of this Government, and that both have required a
liberal indulgence for a portion of human infirmity and error.
The revolutionary wars of Europe, commencing precisely at the
moment when the Government of the United States first went into
operation under this Constitution, excited a collision of
sentiments and of sympathies which kindled all the passions and
imbittered the conflict of parties till the nation was involved
in war and the Union was shaken to its center. This time of trial
embraced a period of five and twenty years, during which the
policy of the Union in its relations with Europe constituted the
principal basis of our political divisions and the most arduous
part of the action of our Federal Government. With the
catastrophe in which the wars of the French Revolution
terminated, and our own subsequent peace with Great Britain, this
baneful weed of party strife was uprooted. From that time no
difference of principle, connected either with the theory of
government or with our intercourse with foreign nations, has
existed or been called forth in force sufficient to sustain a
continued combination of parties or to give more than wholesome
animation to public sentiment or legislative debate. Our
political creed is, without a dissenting voice that can be heard,
that the will of the people is the source and the happiness of
the people the end of all legitimate government upon earth; that
the best security for the beneficence and the best guaranty
against the abuse of power consists in the freedom, the purity,
and the frequency of popular elections; that the General
Government of the Union and the separate governments of the
States are all sovereignties of limited powers, fellow-servants
of the same masters, uncontrolled within their respective
spheres, uncontrollable by encroachments upon each other; that
the firmest security of peace is the preparation during peace of
the defenses of war; that a rigorous economy and accountability
of public expenditures should guard against the aggravation and
alleviate when possible the burden of taxation; that the military
should be kept in strict subordination to the civil power; that
the freedom of the press and of religious opinion should be
inviolate; that the policy of our country is peace and the ark of
our salvation union are articles of faith upon which we are all
now agreed. If there have been those who doubted whether a
confederated representative democracy were a government competent
to the wise and orderly management of the common concerns of a
mighty nation, those doubts have been dispelled; if there have
been projects of partial confederacies to be erected upon the
ruins of the Union, they have been scattered to the winds; if
there have been dangerous attachments to one foreign nation and
antipathies against another, they have been extinguished. Ten
years of peace, at home and abroad, have assuaged the animosities
of political contention and blended into harmony the most
discordant elements of public opinion. There still remains one
effort of magnanimity, one sacrifice of prejudice and passion, to
be made by the individuals throughout the nation who have
heretofore followed the standards of political party. It is that
of discarding every remnant of rancor against each other, of
embracing as countrymen and friends, and of yielding to talents
and virtue alone that confidence which in times of contention for
principle was bestowed only upon those who bore the badge of
party communion.</p>
<p>The collisions of party spirit which originate in speculative
opinions or in different views of administrative policy are in
their nature transitory. Those which are founded on geographical
divisions, adverse interests of soil, climate, and modes of
domestic life are more permanent, and therefore, perhaps, more
dangerous. It is this which gives inestimable value to the
character of our Government, at once federal and national. It
holds out to us a perpetual admonition to preserve alike and with
equal anxiety the rights of each individual State in its own
government and the rights of the whole nation in that of the
Union. Whatsoever is of domestic concernment, unconnected with
the other members of the Union or with foreign lands, belongs
exclusively to the administration of the State governments.
Whatsoever directly involves the rights and interests of the
federative fraternity or of foreign powers is of the resort of
this General Government. The duties of both are obvious in the
general principle, though sometimes perplexed with difficulties
in the detail. To respect the rights of the State governments is
the inviolable duty of that of the Union; the government of every
State will feel its own obligation to respect and preserve the
rights of the whole. The prejudices everywhere too commonly
entertained against distant strangers are worn away, and the
jealousies of jarring interests are allayed by the composition
and functions of the great national councils annually assembled
from all quarters of the Union at this place. Here the
distinguished men from every section of our country, while
meeting to deliberate upon the great interests of those by whom
they are deputed, learn to estimate the talents and do justice to
the virtues of each other. The harmony of the nation is promoted
and the whole Union is knit together by the sentiments of mutual
respect, the habits of social intercourse, and the ties of
personal friendship formed between the representatives of its
several parts in the performance of their service at this
metropolis.</p>
<p>Passing from this general review of the purposes and
injunctions of the Federal Constitution and their results as
indicating the first traces of the path of duty in the discharge
of my public trust, I turn to the administration of my immediate
predecessor as the second. It has passed away in a period of
profound peace, how much to the satisfaction of our country and
to the honor of our country's name is known to you all. The great
features of its policy, in general concurrence with the will of
the Legislature, have been to cherish peace while preparing for
defensive war; to yield exact justice to other nations and
maintain the rights of our own; to cherish the principles of
freedom and of equal rights wherever they were proclaimed; to
discharge with all possible promptitude the national debt; to
reduce within the narrowest limits of efficiency the military
force; to improve the organization and discipline of the Army; to
provide and sustain a school of military science; to extend equal
protection to all the great interests of the nation; to promote
the civilization of the Indian tribes, and to proceed in the
great system of internal improvements within the limits of the
constitutional power of the Union. Under the pledge of these
promises, made by that eminent citizen at the time of his first
induction to this office, in his career of eight years the
internal taxes have been repealed; sixty millions of the public
debt have been discharged; provision has been made for the
comfort and relief of the aged and indigent among the surviving
warriors of the Revolution; the regular armed force has been
reduced and its constitution revised and perfected; the
accountability for the expenditure of public moneys has been made
more effective; the Floridas have been peaceably acquired, and
our boundary has been extended to the Pacific Ocean; the
independence of the southern nations of this hemisphere has been
recognized, and recommended by example and by counsel to the
potentates of Europe; progress has been made in the defense of
the country by fortifications and the increase of the Navy,
toward the effectual suppression of the African traffic in
slaves, in alluring the aboriginal hunters of our land to the
cultivation of the soil and of the mind, in exploring the
interior regions of the Union, and in preparing by scientific
researches and surveys for the further application of our
national resources to the internal improvement of our
country.</p>
<p>In this brief outline of the promise and performance of my
immediate predecessor the line of duty for his successor is
clearly delineated. To pursue to their consummation those
purposes of improvement in our common condition instituted or
recommended by him will embrace the whole sphere of my
obligations. To the topic of internal improvement, emphatically
urged by him at his inauguration, I recur with peculiar
satisfaction. It is that from which I am convinced that the
unborn millions of our posterity who are in future ages to people
this continent will derive their most fervent gratitude to the
founders of the Union; that in which the beneficent action of its
Government will be most deeply felt and acknowledged. The
magnificence and splendor of their public works are among the
imperishable glories of the ancient republics. The roads and
aqueducts of Rome have been the admiration of all after ages, and
have survived thousands of years after all her conquests have
been swallowed up in despotism or become the spoil of barbarians.
Some diversity of opinion has prevailed with regard to the powers
of Congress for legislation upon objects of this nature. The most
respectful deference is due to doubts originating in pure
patriotism and sustained by venerated authority. But nearly
twenty years have passed since the construction of the first
national road was commenced. The authority for its construction
was then unquestioned. To how many thousands of our countrymen
has it proved a benefit? To what single individual has it ever
proved an injury? Repeated, liberal, and candid discussions in
the Legislature have conciliated the sentiments and approximated
the opinions of enlightened minds upon the question of
constitutional power. I can not but hope that by the same process
of friendly, patient, and persevering deliberation all
constitutional objections will ultimately be removed. The extent
and limitation of the powers of the General Government in
relation to this transcendently important interest will be
settled and acknowledged to the common satisfaction of all, and
every speculative scruple will be solved by a practical public
blessing.</p>
<p>Fellow-citizens, you are acquainted with the peculiar
circumstances of the recent election, which have resulted in
affording me the opportunity of addressing you at this time. You
have heard the exposition of the principles which will direct me
in the fulfillment of the high and solemn trust imposed upon me
in this station. Less possessed of your confidence in advance
than any of my predecessors, I am deeply conscious of the
prospect that I shall stand more and oftener in heed of your
indulgence. Intentions upright and pure, a heart devoted to the
welfare of our country, and the unceasing application of all the
faculties allotted to me to her service are all the pledges that
I can give for the faithful performance of the arduous duties I
am to undertake. To the guidance of the legislative councils, to
the assistance of the executive and subordinate departments, to
the friendly cooperation of the respective State governments, to
the candid and liberal support of the people so far as it may be
deserved by honest industry and zeal, I shall look for whatever
success may attend my public service; and knowing that "except
the Lord keep the city the watchman waketh but in vain," with
fervent supplications for His favor, to His overruling providence
I commit with humble but fearless confidence my own fate and the
future destinies of my country.</p>

<h2>FIRST ANNUAL MESSAGE.</h2>
<p><br>
 Washington,<br>
 <i>December 6, 1825</i>.</p>
<p><i>Fellow-Citizens of the Senate and of the House of
Representatives</i>:</p>
<p>In taking a general survey of the concerns of our beloved
country, with reference to subjects interesting to the common
welfare, the first sentiment which impresses itself upon the mind
is of gratitude to the Omnipotent Disposer of All Good for the
continuance of the signal blessings of His providence, and
especially for that health which to an unusual extent has
prevailed within our borders, and for that abundance which in the
vicissitudes of the seasons has been scattered with profusion
over our land. Nor ought we less to ascribe to Him the glory that
we are permitted to enjoy the bounties of His hand in peace and
tranquillity-in peace with all the other nations of the earth, in
tranquillity among ourselves. There has, indeed, rarely been a
period in the history of civilized man in which the general
condition of the Christian nations has been marked so extensively
by peace and prosperity.</p>
<p>Europe, with a few partial and unhappy exceptions, has enjoyed
ten years of peace, during which all her Governments, whatever
the theory of their constitutions may have been, are successively
taught to feel that the end of their institution is the happiness
of the people, and that the exercise of power among men can be
justified only by the blessings it confers upon those over whom
it is extended.</p>
<p>During the same period our intercourse with all those nations
has been pacific and friendly; it so continues. Since the close
of your last session no material variation has occurred in our
relations with any one of them. In the commercial and navigation
system of Great Britain important changes of municipal regulation
have recently been sanctioned by acts of Parliament, the effect
of which upon the interests of other nations, and particularly
upon ours, has not yet been fully developed. In the recent
renewal of the diplomatic missions on both sides between the two
Governments assurances have been given and received of the
continuance and increase of the mutual confidence and cordiality
by which the adjustment of many points of difference had already
been effected, and which affords the surest pledge for the
ultimate satisfactory adjustment of those which still remain open
or may hereafter arise.</p>
<p>The policy of the United States in their commercial
intercourse with other nations has always been of the most
liberal character. In the mutual exchange of their respective
productions they have abstained altogether from prohibitions;
they have interdicted themselves the power of laying taxes upon
exports, and whenever they have favored their own shipping by
special preferences or exclusive privileges in their own ports it
has been only with a view to countervail similar favors and
exclusions granted by the nations with whom we have been engaged
in traffic to their own people or shipping, and to the
disadvantage of ours. Immediately after the close of the last war
a proposal was fairly made by the act of Congress of the 3d of
March, 1815, to all the maritime nations to lay aside the system
of retaliating restrictions and exclusions, and to place the
shipping of both parties to the common trade on a footing of
equality in respect to the duties of tonnage and impost. This
offer was partially and successively accepted by Great Britain,
Sweden, the Netherlands, the Hanseatic cities, Prussia, Sardinia,
the Duke of Oldenburg, and Russia. It was also adopted, under
certain modifications, in our late commercial convention with
France, and by the act of Congress of the 8th January, 1824, it
has received a new confirmation with all the nations who had
acceded to it, and has been offered again to all those who are or
may hereafter be willing to abide in reciprocity by it. But all
these regulations, whether established by treaty or by municipal
enactments, are still subject to one important restriction.</p>
<p>The removal of discriminating duties of tonnage and of impost
is limited to articles of the growth, produce, or manufacture of
the country to which the vessel belongs or to such articles as
are most usually first shipped from her ports. It will deserve
the serious consideration of Congress whether even this remnant
of restriction may not be safely abandoned, and whether the
general tender of equal competition made in the act of 8th
January, 1824, may not be extended to include all articles of
merchandise not prohibited, of what country soever they may be
the produce or manufacture. Propositions to this effect have
already been made to us by more than one European Government, and
it is probable that if once established by legislation or compact
with any distinguished maritime state it would recommend itself
by the experience of its advantages to the general accession of
all.</p>
<p>The convention of commerce and navigation between the United
States and France, concluded on the 24th of June, 1822, was, in
the understanding and intent of both parties, as appears upon its
face, only a temporary arrangement of the points of difference
between them of the most immediate and pressing urgency. It was
limited in the first instance to two years from the 1st of
October, 1822, but with a proviso that it should further continue
in force till the conclusion of a general and definitive treaty
of commerce, unless terminated by a notice, six months in
advance, of either of the parties to the other. Its operation so
far as it extended has been mutually advantageous, and it still
continues in force by common consent. But it left unadjusted
several objects of great interest to the citizens and subjects of
both countries, and particularly a mass of claims to considerable
amount of citizens of the United States upon the Government of
France of indemnity for property taken or destroyed under
circumstances of the most aggravated and outrageous character. In
the long period during which continual and earnest appeals have
been made to the equity and magnanimity of France in behalf of
these claims their justice has not been, as it could not be,
denied. It was hoped that the accession of a new Sovereign to the
throne would have afforded a favorable opportunity for presenting
them to the consideration of his Government. They have been
presented and urged hitherto without effect. The repeated and
earnest representations of our minister at the Court of France
remain as yet even without an answer. Were the demands of nations
upon the justice of each other susceptible of adjudication by the
sentence of an impartial tribunal, those to which I now refer
would long since have been settled and adequate indemnity would
have been obtained. There are large amounts of similar claims
upon the Netherlands, Naples and Denmark. For those upon Spain
prior to 1819 indemnity was, after many years of patient
forbearance, obtained; and those upon Sweden have been lately
compromised by a private settlement, in which the claimants
themselves have acquiesced. The Governments of Denmark and of
Naples have been recently reminded of those yet existing against
them, nor will any of them be forgotten while a hope may be
indulged of obtaining justice by the means within the
constitutional power of the Executive, and without resorting to
those means of self-redress which, as well as the time,
circumstances, and occasion which may require them, are within
the exclusive competency of the Legislature.</p>
<p>It is with great satisfaction that I am enabled to bear
witness to the liberal spirit with which the Republic of Colombia
has made satisfaction for well-established claims of a similar
character, and among the documents now communicated to Congress
will be distinguished a treaty of commerce and navigation with
that Republic, the ratifications of which have been exchanged
since the last recess of the Legislature. The negotiation of
similar treaties with all the independent South American States
has been contemplated and may yet be accomplished. The basis of
them all, as proposed by the United States, has been laid in two
principles-the one of entire and unqualified reciprocity, the
other the mutual obligation of the parties to place each other
permanently upon the footing of the most favored nation. These
principles are, indeed, indispensable to the effectual
emancipation of the American hemisphere from the thraldom of
colonizing monopolies and exclusions, an event rapidly realizing
in the progress of human affairs, and which the resistance still
opposed in certain parts of Europe to the acknowledgment of the
Southern American Republics as independent States will, it is
believed, contribute more effectually to accomplish. The time has
been, and that not remote, when some of those States might, in
their anxious desire to obtain a nominal recognition, have
accepted of a nominal independence, clogged with burdensome
conditions, and exclusive commercial privileges granted to the
nation from which they have separated to the disadvantage of all
others. They are all now aware that such concessions to any
European nation would be incompatible with that independence
which they have declared and maintained.</p>
<p>Among the measures which have been suggested to them by the
new relations with one another, resulting from the recent changes
in their condition, is that of assembling at the Isthmus of
Panama a congress, at which each of them should be represented,
to deliberate upon objects important to the welfare of all. The
Republics of Colombia, of Mexico, and of Central America have
already deputed plenipotentiaries to such a meeting, and they
have invited the United States to be also represented there by
their ministers. The invitation has been accepted, and ministers
on the part of the United States will be commissioned to attend
at those deliberations, and to take part in them so far as may be
compatible with that neutrality from which it is neither our
intention nor the desire of the other American States that we
should depart.</p>
<p>The commissioners under the seventh article of the treaty of
Ghent have so nearly completed their arduous labors that, by the
report recently received from the agent on the part of the United
States, there is reason to expect that the commission will be
closed at their next session, appointed for the 22d of May of the
ensuing year.</p>
<p>The other commission, appointed to ascertain the indemnities
due for slaves carried away from the United States after the
close of the late war, have met with some difficulty, which has
delayed their progress in the inquiry. A reference has been made
to the British Government on the subject, which, it may be hoped,
will tend to hasten the decision of the commissioners, or serve
as a substitute for it.</p>
<p>Among the powers specifically granted to Congress by the
Constitution are those of establishing uniform laws on the
subject of bankruptcies throughout the United States and of
providing for organizing, arming, and disciplining the militia
and for governing such part of them as may be employed in the
service of the United States. The magnitude and complexity of the
interests affected by legislation upon these subjects may account
for the fact that, long and often as both of them have occupied
the attention and animated the debates of Congress, no systems
have yet been devised for fulfilling to the satisfaction of the
community the duties prescribed by these grants of power. To
conciliate the claim of the individual citizen to the enjoyment
of personal liberty, with the effective obligation of private
contracts, is the difficult problem to be solved by a law of
bankruptcy. These are objects of the deepest interest to society,
affecting all that is precious in the existence of multitudes of
persons, many of them in the classes essentially dependent and
helpless, of the age requiring nurture, and of the sex entitled
to protection from the free agency of the parent and the husband.
The organization of the militia is yet more indispensable to the
liberties of the country. It is only by an effective militia that
we can at once enjoy the repose of peace and bid defiance to
foreign aggression; it is by the militia that we are constituted
an armed nation, standing in perpetual panoply of defense in the
presence of all the other nations of the earth. To this end it
would be necessary, if possible, so to shape its organization as
to give it a more united and active energy. There are laws for
establishing an uniform militia throughout the United States and
for arming and equipping its whole body. But it is a body of
dislocated members, without the vigor of unity and having little
of uniformity but the name. To infuse into this most important
institution the power of which it is susceptible and to make it
available for the defense of the Union at the shortest notice and
at the smallest expense possible of time, of life, and of
treasure are among the benefits to be expected from the
persevering deliberations of Congress.</p>
<p>Among the unequivocal indications of our national prosperity
is the flourishing state of our finances. The revenues of the
present year, from all their principal sources, will exceed the
anticipations of the last. The balance in the Treasury on the 1st
of January last was a little short of $2,000,000, exclusive of
two millions and a half, being the moiety of the loan of five
millions authorized by the act of 26th of May, 1824. The receipts
into the Treasury from the 1st of January to the 30th of
September, exclusive of the other moiety of the same loan, are
estimated at $16,500,000, and it is expected that those of the
current quarter will exceed $5,000,000, forming an aggregate of
receipts of nearly twenty-two millions, independent of the loan.
The expenditures of the year will not exceed that sum more than
two millions. By those expenditures nearly eight millions of the
principal of the public debt have been discharged. More than a
million and a half has been devoted to the debt of gratitude to
the warriors of the Revolution; a nearly equal sum to the
construction of fortifications and the acquisition of ordnance
and other permanent preparations of national defense; half a
million to the gradual increase of the Navy; an equal sum for
purchases of territory from the Indians and payment of annuities
to them; and upward of a million for objects of internal
improvement authorized by special acts of the last Congress. If
we add to these $4,000,000 for payment of interest upon the
public debt, there remains a sum of about seven millions, which
have defrayed the whole expense of the administration of
Government in its legislative, executive, and judiciary
departments, including the support of the military and naval
establishments and all the occasional contingencies of a
government coextensive with the Union.</p>
<p>The amount of duties secured on merchandise imported since the
commencement of the year is about twenty-five millions and a
half, and that which will accrue during the current quarter is
estimated at five millions and a half; from these thirty-one
millions, deducting the drawbacks, estimated at less than seven
millions, a sum exceeding twenty-four millions will constitute
the revenue of the year, and will exceed the whole expenditures
of the year. The entire amount of the public debt remaining due
on the 1st of January next will be short of $81,000,000.</p>
<p>By an act of Congress of the 3d of March last a loan of
$12,000,000 was authorized at 4-1/2 per cent, or an exchange of
stock to that amount of 4-1/2 per cent for a stock of 6 per cent,
to create a fund for extinguishing an equal amount of the public
debt, bearing an interest of 6 per cent, redeemable in 1826. An
account of the measures taken to give effect to this act will be
laid before you by the Secretary of the Treasury. As the object
which it had in view has been but partially accomplished, it will
be for the consideration of Congress whether the power with which
it clothed the Executive should not be renewed at an early day of
the present session, and under what modifications.</p>
<p>The act of Congress of the 3d of March last, directing the
Secretary of the Treasury to subscribe, in the name and for the
use of the United States, for 1,500 shares of the capital stock
of the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal Company, has been executed
by the actual subscription for the amount specified; and such
other measures have been adopted by that officer, under the act,
as the fulfillment of its intentions requires. The latest
accounts received of this important undertaking authorize the
belief that it is in successful progress.</p>
<p>The payments into the Treasury from the proceeds of the sales
of the public lands during the present year were estimated at
$1,000,000. The actual receipts of the first two quarters have
fallen very little short of that sum; it is not expected that the
second half of the year will be equally productive, but the
income of the year from that source may now be safely estimated
at a million and a half. The act of Congress of 18th May, 1824,
to provide for the extinguishment of the debt due to the United
States by the purchasers of public lands, was limited in its
operation of relief to the purchaser to the 10th of April last.
Its effect at the end of the quarter during which it expired was
to reduce that debt from ten to seven millions. By the operation
of similar prior laws of relief, from and since that of 2d March,
1821, the debt had been reduced from upward of twenty-two
millions to ten. It is exceedingly desirable that it should be
extinguished altogether; and to facilitate that consummation I
recommend to Congress the revival for one year more of the act of
18th May, 1824, with such provisional modification as may be
necessary to guard the public interests against fraudulent
practices in the resale of the relinquished land. The purchasers
of public lands are among the most useful of our fellow-citizens,
and since the system of sales for cash alone has been introduced
great indulgence has been justly extended to those who had
previously purchased upon credit. The debt which had been
contracted under the credit sales had become unwieldy, and its
extinction was alike advantageous to the purchaser and to the
public. Under the system of sales, matured as it has been by
experience, and adapted to the exigencies of the times, the lands
will continue as they have become, an abundant source of revenue;
and when the pledge of them to the public creditor shall have
been redeemed by the entire discharge of the national debt, the
swelling tide of wealth with which they replenish the common
Treasury may be made to reflow in unfailing streams of
improvement from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<p>The condition of the various branches of the public service
resorting from the Department of War, and their administration
during the current year, will be exhibited in the report of the
Secretary of War and the accompanying documents herewith
communicated. The organization and discipline of the Army are
effective and satisfactory. To counteract the prevalence of
desertion among the troops it has been suggested to withhold from
the men a small portion of their monthly pay until the period of
their discharge; and some expedient appears to be necessary to
preserve and maintain among the officers so much of the art of
horsemanship as could scarcely fail to be found wanting on the
possible sudden eruption of a war, which should take us
unprovided with a single corps of cavalry. The Military Academy
at West Point, under the restrictions of a severe but paternal
superintendence, recommends itself more and more to the patronage
of the nation, and the numbers of meritorious officers which it
forms and introduces to the public service furnishes the means of
multiplying the undertakings of public improvements to which
their acquirements at that institution are peculiarly adapted.
The school of artillery practice established at Fortress Monroe
is well suited to the same purpose, and may heed the aid of
further legislative provision to the same end. The reports of the
various officers at the head of the administrative branches of
the military service, connected with the quartering, clothing,
subsistence, health, and pay of the Army, exhibit the assiduous
vigilance of those officers in the performance of their
respective duties, and the faithful accountability which has
pervaded every part of the system.</p>
<p>Our relations with the numerous tribes of aboriginal natives
of this country, scattered over its extensive surface and so
dependent even for their existence upon our power, have been
during the present year highly interesting. An act of Congress of
25th of May, 1824, made an appropriation to defray the expenses
of making treaties of trade and friendship with the Indian tribes
beyond the Mississippi. An act of 3d of March, 1825, authorized
treaties to be made with the Indians for their consent to the
making of a road from the frontier of Missouri to that of New
Mexico, and another act of the same date provided for defraying
the expenses of holding treaties with the Sioux, Chippeways,
Menomenees, Sauks, Foxes, etc., for the purpose of establishing
boundaries and promoting peace between said tribes. The first and
the last objects of these acts have been accomplished, and the
second is yet in a process of execution. The treaties which since
the last session of Congress have been concluded with the several
tribes will be laid before the Senate for their consideration
conformably to the Constitution. They comprise large and valuable
acquisitions of territory, and they secure an adjustment of
boundaries and give pledges of permanent peace between several
tribes which had been long waging bloody wars against each
other.</p>
<p>On the 12th of February last a treaty was signed at the Indian
Springs between commissioners appointed on the part of the United
States and certain chiefs and individuals of the Creek Nation of
Indians, which was received at the seat of Government only a very
few days before the close of the last session of Congress and of
the late administration. The advice and consent of the Senate was
given to it on the 3d of March, too late for it to receive the
ratification of the then President of the United States; it was
ratified on the 7th of March, under the unsuspecting impression
that it had been negotiated in good faith and in the confidence
inspired by the recommendation of the Senate. The subsequent
transactions in relation to this treaty will form the subject of
a separate communication.</p>
<p>The appropriations made by Congress for public works, as well
in the construction of fortifications as for purposes of internal
improvement, so far as they have been expended, have been
faithfully applied. Their progress has been delayed by the want
of suitable officers for superintending them. An increase of both
the corps of engineers, military and topographical, was
recommended by my predecessor at the last session of Congress.
The reasons upon which that recommendation was founded subsist in
all their force and have acquired additional urgency since that
time. It may also be expedient to organize the topographical
engineers into a corps similar to the present establishment of
the Corps of Engineers. The Military Academy at West Point will
furnish from the cadets annually graduated there officers well
qualified for carrying this measure into effect.</p>
<p>The Board of Engineers for Internal Improvement, appointed for
carrying into execution the act of Congress of 30th of April,
1824, "to procure the necessary surveys, plans, and estimates on
the subject of roads and canals," have been actively engaged in
that service from the close of the last session of Congress. They
have completed the surveys necessary for ascertaining the
practicability of a canal from the Chesapeake Bay to the Ohio
River, and are preparing a full report on that subject, which,
when completed, will be laid before you. The same observation is
to be made with regard to the two other objects of national
importance upon which the Board have been occupied, namely, the
accomplishment of a national road from this city to New Orleans,
and the practicability of uniting the waters of Lake Memphramagog
with Connecticut River and the improvement of the navigation of
that river. The surveys have been made and are nearly completed.
The report may be expected at an early period during the present
session of Congress.</p>
<p>The acts of Congress of the last session relative to the
surveying, marking, or laying out roads in the Territories of
Florida, Arkansas, and Michigan, from Missouri to Mexico, and for
the continuation of the Cumberland road, are, some of them, fully
executed, and others in the process of execution. Those for
completing or commencing fortifications have been delayed only so
far as the Corps of Engineers has been inadequate to furnish
officers for the necessary superintendence of the works. Under
the act confirming the statutes of Virginia and Maryland
incorporating the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal Company, three
commissioners on the part of the United States have been
appointed for opening books and receiving subscriptions, in
concert with a like number of commissioners appointed on the part
of each of those States. A meeting of the commissioners has been
postponed, to await the definitive report of the board of
engineers. The light-houses and monuments for the safety of our
commerce and mariners, the works for the security of Plymouth
Beach and for the preservation of the islands in Boston Harbor,
have received the attention required by the laws relating to
those objects respectively. The continuation of the Cumberland
road, the most important of them all, after surmounting no
inconsiderable difficulty in fixing upon the direction of the
road, has commenced under the most promising auspices, with the
improvements of recent invention in the mode of construction, and
with the advantage of a great reduction in the comparative cost
of the work.</p>
<p>The operation of the laws relating to the Revolutionary
pensioners may deserve the renewed consideration of Congress. The
act of the 18th of March, 1818, while it made provision for many
meritorious and indigent citizens who had served in the War of
Independence, opened a door to numerous abuses and impositions.
To remedy this the act of 1st May, 1820, exacted proofs of
absolute indigence, which many really in want were unable and all
susceptible of that delicacy which is allied to many virtues must
be deeply reluctant to give. The result has been that some among
the least deserving have been retained, and some in whom the
requisites both of worth and want were combined have been
stricken from the list. As the numbers of these venerable relics
of an age gone by diminish; as the decays of body, mind, and
estate of those that survive must in the common course of nature
increase, should not a more liberal portion of indulgence be
dealt out to them? May not the want in most instances be inferred
from the demand when the service can be proved, and may not the
last days of human infirmity be spared the mortification of
purchasing a pittance of relief only by the exposure of its own
necessities? I submit to Congress the expediency of providing for
individual cases of this description by special enactment, or of
revising the act of the 1st of May, 1820, with a view to mitigate
the rigor of its exclusions in favor of persons to whom charity
now bestowed can scarcely discharge the debt of justice.</p>
<p>The portion of the naval force of the Union in actual service
has been chiefly employed on three stations-the Mediterranean,
the coasts of South America bordering on the Pacific Ocean, and
the West Indies. An occasional cruiser has been sent to range
along the African shores most polluted by the traffic of slaves;
one armed vessel has been stationed on the coast of our eastern
boundary, to cruise along the fishing grounds in Hudsons Bay and
on the coast of Labrador, and the first service of a new frigate
has been performed in restoring to his native soil and domestic
enjoyments the veteran hero whose youthful blood and treasure had
freely flowed in the cause of our country's independence, and
whose whole life has been a series of services and sacrifices to
the improvement of his fellow-men. The visit of General
Lafayette, alike honorable to himself and to our country, closed,
as it had commenced, with the most affecting testimonials of
devoted attachment on his part, and of unbounded gratitude of
this people to him in return. It will form hereafter a pleasing
incident in the annals of our Union, giving to real history the
intense interest of romance and signally marking the
unpurchasable tribute of a great nation's social affections to
the disinterested champion of the liberties of human-kind.</p>
<p>The constant maintenance of a small squadron in the
Mediterranean is a necessary substitute for the humiliating
alternative of paying tribute for the security of our commerce in
that sea, and for a precarious peace, at the mercy of every
caprice of four Barbary States, by whom it was liable to be
violated. An additional motive for keeping a respectable force
stationed there at this time is found in the maritime war raging
between the Greeks and the Turks, and in which the neutral
navigation of this Union is always in danger of outrage and
depredation. A few instances have occurred of such depredations
upon our merchant vessels by privateers or pirates wearing the
Grecian flag, but without real authority from the Greek or any
other Government. The heroic struggles of the Greeks themselves,
in which our warmest sympathies as freemen and Christians have
been engaged, have continued to be maintained with vicissitudes
of success adverse and favorable.</p>
<p>Similar motives have rendered expedient the keeping of a like
force on the coasts of Peru and Chile on the Pacific. The
irregular and convulsive character of the war upon the shores has
been extended to the conflicts upon the ocean. An active warfare
has been kept up for years with alternate success, though
generally to the advantage of the American patriots. But their
naval forces have not always been under the control of their own
Governments. Blockades, unjustifiable upon any acknowledged
principles of international law, have been proclaimed by officers
in command, and though disavowed by the supreme authorities, the
protection of our own commerce against them has been made cause
of complaint and erroneous imputations against some of the most
gallant officers of our Navy. Complaints equally groundless have
been made by the commanders of the Spanish royal forces in those
seas; but the most effective protection to our commerce has been
the flag and the firmness of our own commanding officers. The
cessation of the war by the complete triumph of the patriot cause
has removed, it is hoped, all cause of dissension with one party
and all vestige of force of the other. But an unsettled coast of
many degrees of latitude forming a part of our own territory and
a flourishing commerce and fishery extending to the islands of
the Pacific and to China still require that the protecting power
of the Union should be displayed under its flag as well upon the
ocean as upon the land.</p>
<p>The objects of the West India Squadron have been to carry into
execution the laws for the suppression of the African slave
trade; for the protection of our commerce against vessels of
piratical character, though bearing commissions from either of
the belligerent parties; for its protection against open and
unequivocal pirates. These objects during the present year have
been accomplished more effectually than at any former period. The
African slave trade has long been excluded from the use of our
flag, and if some few citizens of our country have continued to
set the laws of the Union as well as those of nature and humanity
at defiance by persevering in that abominable traffic, it has
been only by sheltering themselves under the banners of other
nations less earnest for the total extinction of the trade than
ours. The irregular privateers have within the last year been in
a great measure banished from those seas, and the pirates for
months past appear to have been almost entirely swept away from
the borders and the shores of the two Spanish islands in those
regions. The active, persevering, and unremitted energy of
Captain Warrington and of the officers and men under his command
on that trying and perilous service have been crowned with signal
success, and are entitled to the approbation of their country.
But experience has shown that not even a temporary suspension or
relaxation from assiduity can be indulged on that station without
reproducing piracy and murder in all their horrors; nor is it
probable that for years to come our immensely valuable commerce
in those seas can navigate in security without the steady
continuance of an armed force devoted to its protection.</p>
<p>It were, indeed, a vain and dangerous illusion to believe that
in the present or probable condition of human society a commerce
so extensive and so rich as ours could exist and be pursued in
safety without the continual support of a military marine-the
only arm by which the power of this Confederacy can be estimated
or felt by foreign nations, and the only standing military force
which can never be dangerous to our own liberties at home. A
permanent naval peace establishment, therefore, adapted to our
present condition, and adaptable to that gigantic growth with
which the nation is advancing in its career, is among the
subjects which have already occupied the foresight of the last
Congress, and which will deserve your serious deliberations. Our
Navy, commenced at an early period of our present political
organization upon a scale commensurate with the incipient
energies, the scanty resources, and the comparative indigence of
our infancy, was even then found adequate to cope with all the
powers of Barbary, save the first, and with one of the principal
maritime powers of Europe.</p>
<p>At a period of further advancement, but with little accession
of strength, it not only sustained with honor the most unequal of
conflicts, but covered itself and our country with unfading
glory. But it is only since the close of the late war that by the
numbers and force of the ships of which it was composed it could
deserve the name of a navy. Yet it retains nearly the same
organization as when it consisted only of five frigates. The
rules and regulations by which it is governed earnestly call for
revision, and the want of a naval school of instruction,
corresponding with the Military Academy at West Point, for the
formation of scientific and accomplished officers, is felt with
daily increasing aggravation.</p>
<p>The act of Congress of 26th of May, 1824, authorizing an
examination and survey of the harbor of Charleston, in South
Carolina, of St. Marys, in Georgia, and of the coast of Florida,
and for other purposes, has been executed so far as the
appropriation would admit. Those of the 3d of March last,
authorizing the establishment of a navy-yard and depot on the
coast of Florida, in the Gulf of Mexico, and authorizing the
building of ten sloops of war, and for other purposes, are in the
course of execution, for the particulars of which and other
objects connected with this Department I refer to the report of
the Secretary of the Navy, herewith communicated.</p>
<p>A report from the Postmaster-General is also submitted,
exhibiting the present flourishing condition of that Department.
For the first time for many years the receipts for the year
ending on the 1st of July last exceeded the expenditures during
the same period to the amount of more than $45,000. Other facts
equally creditable to the administration of this Department are
that in two years from the 1st of July, 1823, an improvement of
more than $185,000 in its pecuniary affairs has been realized;
that in the same interval the increase of the transportation of
the mail has exceeded 1,500,000 miles annually, and that 1,040
new post-offices have been established. It hence appears that
under judicious management the income from this establishment may
be relied on as fully adequate to defray its expenses, and that
by the discontinuance of post-roads altogether unproductive
others of more useful character may be opened, till the
circulation of the mail shall keep pace with the spread of our
population, and the comforts of friendly correspondence, the
exchanges of internal traffic, and the lights of the periodical
press shall be distributed to the remotest corners of the Union,
at a charge scarcely perceptible to any individual, and without
the cost of a dollar to the public Treasury.</p>
<p>Upon this first occasion of addressing the Legislature of the
Union, with which I have been honored, in presenting to their
view the execution so far as it has been effected of the measures
sanctioned by them for promoting the internal improvement of our
country, I can not close the communication without recommending
to their calm and persevering consideration the general principle
in a more enlarged extent. The great object of the institution of
civil government is the improvement of the condition of those who
are parties to the social compact, and no government, in whatever
form constituted, can accomplish the lawful ends of its
institution but in proportion as it improves the condition of
those over whom it is established. Roads and canals, by
multiplying and facilitating the communications and intercourse
between distant regions and multitudes of men, are among the most
important means of improvement. But moral, political,
intellectual improvement are duties assigned by the Author of Our
existence to social no less than to individual man. For the
fulfillment of those duties governments are invested with power,
and to the attainment of the end-the progressive improvement of
the condition of the governed-the exercise of delegated powers is
a duty as sacred and indispensable as the usurpation of powers
not granted is criminal and odious. Among the first, perhaps the
very first, instrument for the improvement of the condition of
men is knowledge, and to the acquisition of much of the knowledge
adapted to the wants, the comforts, and enjoyments of human life
public institutions and seminaries of learning are essential. So
convinced of this was the first of my predecessors in this
office, now first in the memory, as, living, he was first in the
hearts, of our countrymen, that once and again in his addresses
to the Congresses with whom he cooperated in the public service
he earnestly recommended the establishment of seminaries of
learning, to prepare for all the emergencies of peace and war-a
national university and a military academy. With respect to the
latter, had he lived to the present day, in turning his eyes to
the institution at West Point he would have enjoyed the
gratification of his most earnest wishes; but in surveying the
city which has been honored with his name he would have seen the
spot of earth which he had destined and bequeathed to the use and
benefit of his country as the site for an university still bare
and barren.</p>
<p>In assuming her station among the civilized nations of the
earth it would seem that our country had contracted the
engagement to contribute her share of mind, of labor, and of
expense to the improvement of those parts of knowledge which lie
beyond the reach of individual acquisition, and particularly to
geographical and astronomical science. Looking back to the
history only of the half century since the declaration of our
independence, and observing the generous emulation with which the
Governments of France, Great Britain, and Russia have devoted the
genius, the intelligence, the treasures of their respective
nations to the common improvement of the species in these
branches of science, is it not incumbent upon us to inquire
whether we are not bound by obligations of a high and honorable
character to contribute our portion of energy and exertion to the
common stock? The voyages of discovery prosecuted in the course
of that time at the expense of those nations have not only
redounded to their glory, but to the improvement of human
knowledge. We have been partakers of that improvement and owe for
it a sacred debt, not only of gratitude, but of equal or
proportional exertion in the same common cause. Of the cost of
these undertakings, if the mere expenditures of outfit,
equipment, and completion of the expeditions were to be
considered the only charges, it would be unworthy of a great and
generous nation to take a second thought. One hundred expeditions
of circumnavigation like those of Cook and La P&eacute;rouse
would not burden the exchequer of the nation fitting them out so
much as the ways and means of defraying a single campaign in war.
But if we take into the account the lives of those benefactors of
mankind of which their services in the cause of their species
were the purchase, how shall the cost of those heroic enterprises
be estimated, and what compensation can be made to them or to
their countries for them? Is it not by bearing them in
affectionate remembrance? Is it not still more by imitating their
example-by enabling countrymen of our own to pursue the same
career and to hazard their lives in the same cause?</p>
<p>In inviting the attention of Congress to the subject of
internal improvements upon a view thus enlarged it is not my
design to recommend the equipment of an expedition for
circumnavigating the globe for purposes of scientific research
and inquiry. We have objects of useful investigation hearer home,
and to which our cares may be more beneficially applied. The
interior of our own territories has yet been very imperfectly
explored. Our coasts along many degrees of latitude upon the
shores of the Pacific Ocean, though much frequented by our
spirited commercial navigators, have been barely visited by our
public ships. The River of the West, first fully discovered and
navigated by a countryman of our own, still bears the name of the
ship in which he ascended its waters, and claims the protection
of our armed national flag at its mouth. With the establishment
of a military post there or at some other point of that coast,
recommended by my predecessor and already matured in the
deliberations of the last Congress, I would suggest the
expediency of connecting the equipment of a public ship for the
exploration of the whole northwest coast of this continent.</p>
<p>The establishment of an uniform standard of weights and
measures was one of the specific objects contemplated in the
formation of our Constitution, and to fix that standard was one
of the powers delegated by express terms in that instrument to
Congress. The Governments of Great Britain and France have
scarcely ceased to be occupied with inquiries and speculations on
the same subject since the existence of our Constitution, and
with them it has expanded into profound, laborious, and expensive
researches into the figure of the earth and the comparative
length of the pendulum vibrating seconds in various latitudes
from the equator to the pole. These researches have resulted in
the composition and publication of several works highly
interesting to the cause of science. The experiments are yet in
the process of performance. Some of them have recently been made
on our own shores, within the walls of one of our own colleges,
and partly by one of our own fellow-citizens. It would be
honorable to our country if the sequel of the same experiments
should be countenanced by the patronage of our Government, as
they have hitherto been by those of France and Britain.</p>
<p>Connected with the establishment of an university, or separate
from it, might be undertaken the erection of an astronomical
observatory, with provision for the support of an astronomer, to
be in constant attendance of observation upon the phenomena of
the heavens, and for the periodical publication of his
observations. It is with no feeling of pride as an American that
the remark may be made that on the comparatively small
territorial surface of Europe there are existing upward of 130 of
these light-houses of the skies, while throughout the whole
American hemisphere there is not one. If we reflect a moment upon
the discoveries which in the last four centuries have been made
in the physical constitution of the universe by the means of
these buildings and of observers stationed in them, shall we
doubt of their usefulness to every nation? And while scarcely a
year passes over our heads without bringing some new astronomical
discovery to light, which we must fain receive at second hand
from Europe, are we not cutting ourselves off from the means of
returning light for light while we have neither observatory nor
observer upon our half of the globe and the earth revolves in
perpetual darkness to our unsearching eyes?</p>
<p>When, on the 25th of October, 1791, the first President of the
United States announced to Congress the result of the first
enumeration of the inhabitants of this Union, he informed them
that the returns gave the pleasing assurance that the population
of the United States bordered on 4,000,000 persons. At the
distance of thirty years from that time the last enumeration,
five years since completed, presented a population bordering upon
10,000,000. Perhaps of all the evidences of a prosperous and
happy condition of human society the rapidity of the increase of
population is the most unequivocal. But the demonstration of our
prosperity rests not alone upon this indication. Our commerce,
our wealth, and the extent of our territories have increased in
corresponding proportions, and the number of independent
communities associated in our Federal Union has since that time
nearly doubled. The legislative representation of the States and
people in the two Houses of Congress has grown with the growth of
their constituent bodies. The House, which then consisted of 65
members, now numbers upward of 200. The Senate, which consisted
of 26 members, has now 48. But the executive and, still more, the
judiciary departments are yet in a great measure confined to
their primitive organization, and are now not adequate to the
urgent wants of a still growing community.</p>
<p>The naval armaments, which at an early period forced
themselves upon the necessities of the Union, soon led to the
establishment of a Department of the Navy. But the Departments of
Foreign Affairs and of the Interior, which early after the
formation of the Government had been united in one, continue so
united to this time, to the unquestionable detriment of the
public service. The multiplication of our relations with the
nations and Governments of the Old World has kept pace with that
of our population and commerce, while within the last ten years a
new family of nations in our own hemisphere has arisen among the
inhabitants of the earth, with whom our intercourse, commercial
and political, would of itself furnish occupation to an active
and industrious department. The constitution of the judiciary,
experimental and imperfect as it was even in the infancy of our
existing Government, is yet more inadequate to the administration
of national justice at our present maturity. Nine years have
elapsed since a predecessor in this office, now not the last, the
citizen who, perhaps, of all others throughout the Union
contributed most to the formation and establishment of our
Constitution, in his valedictory address to Congress, immediately
preceding his retirement from public life, urgently recommended
the revision of the judiciary and the establishment of an
additional executive department. The exigencies of the public
service and its unavoidable deficiencies, as now in exercise,
have added yearly cumulative weight to the considerations
presented by him as persuasive to the measure, and in
recommending it to your deliberations I am happy to have the
influence of his high authority in aid of the undoubting
convictions of my own experience.</p>
<p>The laws relating to the administration of the Patent Office
are deserving of much consideration and perhaps susceptible of
some improvement. The grant of power to regulate the action of
Congress upon this subject has specified both the end to be
obtained and the means by which it is to be effected, "to promote
the progress of science and useful arts by securing for limited
times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their
respective writings and discoveries." If an honest pride might be
indulged in the reflection that on the records of that office are
already found inventions the usefulness of which has scarcely
been transcended in the annals of human ingenuity, would not its
exultation be allayed by the inquiry whether the laws have
effectively insured to the inventors the reward destined to them
by the Constitution-even a limited term of exclusive right to
their discoveries?</p>
<p>On the 24th of December, 1799, it was resolved by Congress
that a marble monument should be erected by the United States in
the Capitol at the city of Washington; that the family of General
Washington should be requested to permit his body to be deposited
under it, and that the monument be so designed as to commemorate
the great events of his military and political life. In reminding
Congress of this resolution and that the monument contemplated by
it remains yet without execution, I shall indulge only the
remarks that the works at the Capitol are approaching to
completion; that the consent of the family, desired by the
resolution, was requested and obtained; that a monument has been
recently erected in this city over the remains of another
distinguished patriot of the Revolution, and that a spot has been
reserved within the walls where you are deliberating for the
benefit of this and future ages, in which the mortal remains may
be deposited of him whose spirit hovers over you and listens with
delight to every act of the representatives of his nation which
can tend to exalt and adorn his and their country.</p>
<p>The Constitution under which you are assembled is a charter of
limited powers. After full and solemn deliberation upon all or
any of the objects which, urged by an irresistible sense of my
own duty, I have recommended to your attention should you come to
the conclusion that, however desirable in themselves, the
enactment of laws for effecting them would transcend the powers
committed to you by that venerable instrument which we are all
bound to support, let no consideration induce you to assume the
exercise of powers not granted to you by the people. But if the
power to exercise exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever
over the district of Columbia; if the power to lay and collect
taxes, duties, imposts, and excises, to pay the debts and provide
for the common defense and general welfare of the United States;
if the power to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among
the several States and with the Indian tribes, to fix the
standard of weights and measures, to establish post-offices and
post-roads, to declare war, to raise and support armies, to
provide and maintain a navy, to dispose of and make all heedful
rules and regulations respecting the territory or other property
belonging to the United States, and to make all laws which shall
be necessary and proper for carrying these powers into
execution-if these powers and others enumerated in the
Constitution may be effectually brought into action by laws
promoting the improvement of agriculture, commerce, and
manufactures, the cultivation and encouragement of the mechanic
and of the elegant arts, the advancement of literature, and the
progress of the sciences, ornamental and profound, to refrain
from exercising them for the benefit of the people themselves
would be to hide in the earth the talent committed to our
charge-would be treachery to the most sacred of trusts.</p>
<p>The spirit of improvement is abroad upon the earth. It
stimulates the hearts and sharpens the faculties not of our
fellow-citizens alone, but of the nations of Europe and of their
rulers. While dwelling with pleasing satisfaction upon the
superior excellence of our political institutions, let us not be
unmindful that liberty is power; that the nation blessed with the
largest portion of liberty must in proportion to its numbers be
the most powerful nation upon earth, and that the tenure of power
by man is, in the moral purposes of his Creator, upon condition
that it shall be exercised to ends of beneficence, to improve the
condition of himself and his fellow-men. While foreign nations
less blessed with that freedom which is power than ourselves are
advancing with gigantic strides in the career of public
improvement, were we to slumber in indolence or fold up our arms
and proclaim to the world that we are palsied by the will of our
constituents, would it not be to cast away the bounties of
Providence and doom ourselves to perpetual inferiority? In the
course of the year now drawing to its close we have beheld, under
the auspices and at the expense of one State of this Union, a new
university unfolding its portals to the sons of science and
holding up the torch of human improvement to eyes that seek the
light. We have seen under the persevering and enlightened
enterprise of another State the waters of our Western lakes
mingle with those of the ocean. If undertakings like these have
been accomplished in the compass of a few years by the authority
of single members of our Confederation, can we, the
representative authorities of the whole Union, fall behind our
fellow-servants in the exercise of the trust committed to us for
the benefit of our common sovereign by the accomplishment of
works important to the whole and to which neither the authority
nor the resources of any one State can be adequate?</p>
<p>Finally, fellow-citizens, I shall await with cheering hope and
faithful cooperation the result of your deliberations, assured
that, without encroaching upon the powers reserved to the
authorities of the respective States or to the people, you will,
with a due sense of your obligations to your country and of the
high responsibilities weighing upon yourselves, give efficacy to
the means committed to you for the common good. And may He who
searches the hearts of the children of men prosper your exertions
to secure the blessings of peace and promote the highest welfare
of our country.</p>

<h2>SPECIAL MESSAGES.</h2>
<p><br>
 Washington,<br>
 <i>December 14, 1825</i>.</p>
<p><i>To the Senate of the United States</i>:</p>
<p>I transmit to the Senate, for their consideration and advice
with regard to their ratification, the following treaties:</p>
<p>1. A treaty between the United States and the Great and Little

authorized and empowered by the same.</p>
<p>John Quincy Adams.</p>
<p><br>
 Washington,<br>
 <i>December 15, 1825</i>.</p>
<p><i>To the Senate of the United States</i>:</p>
<p>I transmit herewith to the Senate, for their consideration in
reference to its ratification, a general convention of peace,
amity, commerce, and navigation between the United States of
America and the Federation of the Centre of America, signed at
this place on the 5th instant by the Secretary of State and the
minister plenipotentiary from the Republic of Central America to
the United States.</p>
<p>John Quincy Adams.</p>
<p><br>
 Washington,<br>
 <i>December 26, 1825</i></p>
<p><i>To the Senate of the United States</i>:</p>
<p>In the message to both Houses of Congress at the commencement
of the session it was mentioned that the Governments of the
Republics of Colombia, of Mexico, and of Central America had
severally invited the Government of the United States to be
represented at the Congress of American nations to be assembled
at Panama to deliberate upon objects of peculiar concernment to
this hemisphere, and that this invitation had been accepted.</p>
<p>Although this measure was deemed to be within the
constitutional competency of the Executive, I have not thought
proper to take any step in it before ascertaining that my opinion
of its expediency will concur with that of both branches of the
Legislature, first, by the decision of the Senate upon the
nominations to be laid before them, and, secondly, by the
sanction of both Houses to the appropriations, without which it
can not be carried into effect.</p>
<p>A report from the Secretary of State and copies of the
correspondence with the South American Governments on this
subject since the invitation given by them are herewith
transmitted to the Senate. They will disclose the objects of
importance which are expected to form a subject of discussion at
this meeting, in which interests of high importance to this Union
are involved. It will be seen that the United States neither
intend nor are expected to take part in any deliberations of a
belligerent character; that the motive of their attendance is
neither to contract alliances nor to engage in any undertaking or
project importing hostility to any other nation.</p>
<p>But the Southern American nations, in the infancy of their
independence, often find themselves in positions with reference
to other countries with the principles applicable to which,
derivable from the state of independence itself, they have not
been familiarized by experience. The result of this has been that
sometimes in their intercourse with the United States they have
manifested dispositions to reserve a right of granting special
favors and privileges to the Spanish nation as the price of their
recognition. At others they have actually established duties and
impositions operating unfavorably to the United States to the
advantage of other European powers, and sometimes they have
appeared to consider that they might interchange among themselves
mutual concessions of exclusive favor, to which neither European
powers nor the United States should be admitted. In most of these
cases their regulations unfavorable to us have yielded to
friendly expostulation and remonstrance. But it is believed to be
of infinite moment that the principles of a liberal commercial
intercourse should be exhibited to them, and urged with
disinterested and friendly persuasion upon them when all
assembled for the avowed purpose of consulting together upon the
establishment of such principles as may have an important bearing
upon their future welfare.</p>
<p>The consentaneous adoption of principles of maritime
neutrality, and favorable to the navigation of peace, and
commerce in time of war, will also form a subject of
consideration to this Congress. The doctrine that free ships make
free goods and the restrictions of reason upon the extent of
blockades may be established by general agreement with far more
ease, and perhaps with less danger, by the general engagement to
adhere to them concerted at such a meeting, than by partial
treaties or conventions with each of the nations separately. An
agreement between all the parties represented at the meeting that
each will guard by its own means against the establishment of any
future European colony within its borders may be found advisable.
This was more than two years since announced by my predecessor to
the world as a principle resulting from the emancipation of both
the American continents. It may be so developed to the new
southern nations that they will all feel it as an essential
appendage to their independence.</p>
<p>There is yet another subject upon which, without entering into
any treaty, the moral influence of the United States may perhaps
be exerted with beneficial consequences at such a meeting-the
advancement of religious liberty. Some of the southern nations
are even yet so far under the dominion of prejudice that they
have incorporated with their political constitutions an exclusive
church, without toleration of any other than the dominant sect.
The abandonment of this last badge of religious bigotry and
oppression may be pressed more effectually by the united
exertions of those who concur in the principles of freedom of
conscience upon those who are yet to be convinced of their
justice and wisdom than by the solitary efforts of a minister to
any one of the separate Governments.</p>
<p>The indirect influence which the United States may exercise
upon any projects or purposes originating in the war in which the
southern Republics are still engaged, which might seriously
affect the interests of this Union, and the good offices by which
the United States may ultimately contribute to bring that war to
a speedier termination, though among the motives which have
convinced me of the propriety of complying with this invitation,
are so far contingent and eventual that it would be improper to
dwell upon them more at large.</p>
<p>In fine, a decisive inducement with me for acceding to the
measure is to show by this token of respect to the southern
Republics the interest that we take in their welfare and our
disposition to comply with their wishes. Having been the first to
recognize their independence, and sympathized with them so far as
was compatible with our neutral duties in all their struggles and
sufferings to acquire it, we have laid the foundation of our
future intercourse with them in the broadest principles of
reciprocity and the most cordial feelings of fraternal
friendship. To extend those principles to all our commercial
relations with them and to hand down that friendship to future
ages is congenial to the highest policy of the Union, as it will
be to that of all those nations and their posterity. In the
confidence that these sentiments will meet the approbation of the
Senate, I nominate Richard C. Anderson, of Kentucky, and John
Sergeant, of Pennsylvania, to be envoys extraordinary and
ministers plenipotentiary to the assembly of American nations at
Panama, and William B. Rochester, of New York, to be secretary to
the mission.</p>

<p>John Quincy Adams.</p>
<p><br>
 Washington,<br>
 <i>January 31, 1826</i></p>
<p><i>To the Senate of the United States</i>:</p>
<p>I transmit herewith to the Senate, for their consideration and
advice with regard to its ratification, a treaty concluded by the
Secretary of War, duly authorized thereto, with the chiefs and
headmen of the Creek Nation, deputed by them, and now in this
city.</p>
<p>It has been agreed upon, and is presented to the consideration
of the Senate as a substitute for the treaty signed at the Indian
Springs on the 12th of February last. The circumstances under
which this received on the 3d of March last your advice and
consent to its ratification are known to you. It was transmitted
to me from the Senate on the 5th of March, and ratified in full
confidence yielded to the advice and consent of the Senate, under
a firm belief, founded on the journal of the commissioners of the
United States and on the express statements in the letter of one
of them of the 16th of February to the then Secretary of War,
that it had been concluded with a large majority of the chiefs of
the Creek Nation and with a reasonable prospect of immediate
acquiescence by the remainder.</p>
<p>This expectation has not merely been disappointed. The first
measures for carrying the treaty into execution had scarcely been
taken when the two principal chiefs who had signed it fell
victims to the exasperation of the great mass of the nation, and
their families and dependents, far from being able to execute the
engagements on their part, fled for life, safety, and subsistence
from the territories which they had assumed to cede, to our own.
Yet, in this fugitive condition, and while subsisting on the
bounty of the United States, they have been found advancing
pretensions to receive exclusively to themselves the whole of the
sums stipulated by the commissioners of the United States in
payment <i>for all</i> the lands of the Creek Nation which were
ceded by the terms of the treaty. And they have claimed the
stipulation of the eighth article, that the United States would
"<i>protect</i> the emigrating party against the encroachments,
hostilities, and impositions of the whites and of all others," as
an engagement by which the United States were bound to become the
instruments of their vengeance and to inflict upon the majority
of the Creek Nation the punishment of Indian retribution to
gratify the vindictive fury of an impotent and helpless minority
of their own tribe.</p>
<p>In this state of things the question is not whether the treaty
of the 12th of February last shall or shall not be executed. So
far as the United States were or could be bound by it I have been
anxiously desirous of carrying it into execution. But, like other
treaties, its fulfillment depends upon the will not of one but of
both the parties to it. The parties on the face of the treaty are
the United States and the Creek Nation, and however desirous one
of them may be to give it effect, this wish must prove abortive
while the other party refuses to perform its stipulations and
disavows its obligations. By the refusal of the Creek Nation to
perform their part of the treaty the United States are absolved
from all its engagements on their part, and the alternative left
them is either to resort to measures of war to secure by force
the advantages stipulated to them in the treaty or to attempt the
adjustment of the interest by a new compact. In the preference
dictated by the nature of our institutions and by the sentiments
of justice and humanity which the occasion requires for measures
of peace the treaty herewith transmitted has been concluded, and
is submitted to the decision of the Senate. After exhausting
every effort in our power to obtain the acquiescence of the Creek
Nation to the treaty of the 12th of February, I entertained for
some time the hope that their assent might at least have been
given to a new treaty, by which all their lands within the State
of Georgia should have been ceded. This has also proved
impracticable, and although the excepted portion is of
comparatively small amount and importance, I have assented to its
exception so far as to place it before the Senate only from a
conviction that between it and a resort to the forcible expulsion
of the Creeks from their habitations and lands within the State
of Georgia there was no middle term.</p>
<p>The deputation with which this treaty has been concluded
consists of the principal chiefs of the nation-able not only to
negotiate but to carry into effect the stipulations to which they
have agreed. There is a deputation also here from the small party
which undertook to contract for the whole nation at the treaty of
the 12th of February, but the number of which, according to the
information collected by General Gaines, does not exceed 400.
They represent themselves, indeed, to be far more numerous, but
whatever their number may be their interests have been provided
for in the treaty now submitted. Their subscriptions to it would
also have been received but for unreasonable pretensions raised
by them after all the arrangements of the treaty had been agreed
upon and it was actually signed. Whatever their merits may have
been in the facility with which they ceded all the lands of their
nation within the State of Georgia, their utter inability to
perform the engagements which they so readily contracted and the
exorbitancy of their demands when compared with the inefficiency
of their own means of performance leave them with no claims upon
the United States other than of impartial and rigorous
justice.</p>
<p>In referring to the impressions under which I ratified the
treaty of the 12th of February last, I do not deem it necessary
to decide upon the propriety of the manner in which it was
negotiated. Deeply regretting the recriminations and
recriminations to which these events have given rise, I believe
the public interest will best be consulted by discarding them
altogether from the discussion of the subject. The great body of
the Creek Nation inflexibly refuse to acknowledge or to execute
that treaty. Upon this ground it will be set aside, should the
Senate advise and consent to the ratification of that now
communicated, without looking back to the means by which the
other was effected. And in the adjustment of the terms of the
present treaty I have been peculiarly anxious to dispense a
measure of great liberality to both parties of the Creek Nation,
rather than to extort from them a bargain of which the advantages
on our part could only be purchased by hardship on theirs.</p>

 Washington,<br>
 <i>March 15, 1826</i>. <i>To the House of Representatives of the
United States</i>:</p>
<p>In compliance with the resolution of the House of the 5th
ultimo, requesting me to cause to be laid before the House so
much of the correspondence between the Government of the United
States and the new States of America, or their ministers,
respecting the proposed congress or meeting of diplomatic agents
at Panama, and such information respecting the general character
of that expected congress as may be in my possession and as may,
in my opinion, be communicated without prejudice to the public
interest, and also to inform the House, so far as in my opinion
the public interest may allow, in regard to what objects the
agents of the United States are expected to take part in the
deliberations of that congress, I now transmit to the House a
report from the Secretary of State, with the correspondence and
information requested by the resolution.</p>
<p>With regard to the objects in which the agents of the United
States are expected to take part in the deliberations of that
congress, I deem it proper to premise that these objects did not
form the only, nor even the principal, motive for my acceptance
of the invitation. My first and greatest inducement was to meet
in the spirit of kindness and friendship an overture made in that
spirit by three sister Republics of this hemisphere.</p>
<p>The great revolution in human affairs which has brought into
existence, nearly at the same time, eight sovereign and
independent nations in our own quarter of the globe has placed
the United States in a situation not less novel and scarcely less
interesting than that in which they had found themselves by their
own transition from a cluster of colonies to a nation of
sovereign States. The deliverance of the Southern American
Republics from the oppression under which they had been so long
afflicted was hailed with great unanimity by the people of this
Union as among the most auspicious events of the age. On the 4th
of May, 1822, an act of Congress made an appropriation of
$100,000 "for such missions to the independent nations on the
American continent as the President of the United States might
deem proper." In exercising the authority recognized by this act
my predecessor, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate
appointed successively ministers plenipotentiary to the Republics
of Colombia, Buenos Ayres, Chili, and Mexico. Unwilling to raise
among the fraternity of freedom questions of precedency and
etiquette, which even the European monarchs had of late found it
necessary in a great measure to discard, he dispatched these
ministers to Colombia, Buenos Ayres, and Chili without exacting
from those Republics, as by the ancient principles of political
primogeniture he might have done, that the compliment of a
plenipotentiary mission should have been paid <i>first</i> by
them to the United States. The instructions, prepared under his
direction, to Mr. Anderson, the first of our ministers to the
southern continent, contain at much length the general principles
upon which he thought it desirable that our relations, political
and commercial, with these our new neighbors should be
established for their benefit and ours and that of the future
ages of our posterity. A copy of so much of these instructions as
relates to these general subjects is among the papers now
transmitted to the House. Similar instructions were furnished to
the ministers appointed to Buenos Ayres, Chili, and Mexico, and
the system of social intercourse which it was the purpose of
those missions to establish from the first opening of our
diplomatic relations with those rising nations is the most
effective exposition of the principles upon which the invitation
to the congress at Panama has been accepted by me, as well as of
the objects of negotiation at that meeting, in which, it was that
our plenipotentiaries should take part.</p>
<p>The House will perceive that even at the date of these
instructions the first treaties between some of the southern
Republics had been concluded, by which they had stipulated among
themselves this diplomatic assembly at Panama. And it will be
seen with what caution, so far as it might concern the policy of
the United States, and at the same time with what frankness and
good will toward those nations, he gave countenance to their
design of inviting the United States to this high assembly for
consultation upon <i>American interests</i>. It was not
considered a conclusive reason for declining this invitation that
the proposal for assembling such a Congress had not first been
made by ourselves. It had sprung from the urgent, immediate, and
momentous common interests of the great communities struggling
for independence, and, as it were, quickening into life. From
them the proposition to us appeared respectful and friendly; from
us to them it could scarcely have been made without exposing
ourselves to suspicions of purposes of ambition, if not of
domination, more suited to rouse resistance and excite distrust
than to conciliate favor and friendship. The first and paramount
principle upon which it was deemed wise and just to lay the
corner stone of all our future relations with them was
<i>disinterestedness</i>; the next was cordial good will to them;
the third was a claim of fair and equal reciprocity. Under these
impressions when the invitation was formally and earnestly given,
had it even been doubtful whether <i>any</i> of the objects
proposed for consideration and discussion at the Congress were
such as that immediate and important interests of the United
States would be affected by the issue, I should, nevertheless,
have determined so far as it depended upon me to have accepted
the invitation and to have appointed ministers to attend the
meeting. The proposal itself implied that the Republics by whom
it was made <i>believed</i> that important interests of ours or
of theirs rendered our attendance there desirable. They had given
us notice that in the novelty of their situation and in the
spirit of deference to our experience they would be pleased to
have the benefit of our friendly counsel. To meet the temper with
which this proposal was made with a cold repulse was not thought
congenial to that warm interest in their welfare with which the
people and Government of the Union had hitherto gone hand in hand
through the whole progress of their revolution. To insult them by
a refusal of their overture, and then invite them to a similar
assembly to be called by ourselves, was an expedient which never
presented itself to the mind. I would have sent ministers to the
meeting had it been merely to give them such advice as they might
have desired, even with reference to <i>their own</i> interests,
not involving ours. I would have sent them had it been merely to
explain and set forth to them our reasons for <i>declining</i>
any proposal of specific measures to which they might desire our
concurrence, but which we might deem incompatible with our
interests or our duties. In the intercourse between nations
temper is a missionary perhaps more powerful than talent. Nothing
was ever lost by kind treatment. Nothing can be gained by sullen
repulses and aspiring pretensions.</p>
<p>But objects of the highest importance, not only to the future
welfare of the whole human race, but bearing directly upon the
special interests of this Union, <i>will</i> engage the
deliberations of the congress of Panama whether we are
represented there or not. Others, if we are represented, may be
offered by our plenipotentiaries for consideration having in view
both these great results-our own interests and the improvement of
the condition of man upon earth. It may be that in the lapse of
many centuries no other opportunity so favorable will be
presented to the Government of the United States to subserve the
benevolent purposes of Divine Providence; to dispense the
promised blessings of the Redeemer of Mankind; to promote the
prevalence in future ages of peace on earth and good will to man,
as will now be placed in their power by participating in the
deliberations of this congress.</p>
<p>Among the topics enumerated in official papers published by
the Republic of Colombia, and adverted to in the correspondence
now communicated to the House, as intended to be presented for
discussion at Panama, there is scarcely one in which the
<i>result</i> of the meeting will not deeply affect the interests
of the United States. Even those in which the belligerent States
alone will take an active part will have a powerful effect upon
the state of our relations with the American, and probably with
the principal European, States. Were it merely that we might be
correctly and speedily informed of the proceedings of the
congress and of the progress and issue of their negotiations, I
should hold it advisable that we should have an accredited agency
with them, placed in such confidential relations with the other
members as would insure the authenticity and the safe and early
transmission of its reports. Of the same enumerated topics are
the preparation of a manifesto setting forth to the world the
justice of their cause and the relations they desire to hold with
other Christian powers, and to form a convention of navigation
and commerce applicable both to the confederated States and to
their allies.</p>
<p>It will be within the recollection of the House that
immediately after the close of the war of our independence a
measure closely analogous to this congress of Panama was adopted
by the Congress of our Confederation, and for purposes of
precisely the same character. Three commissioners with
plenipotentiary powers were appointed to negotiate treaties of
amity, navigation, and commerce with all the principal powers of
Europe. They met and resided for that purpose about one year at
Paris, and the only result of their negotiations at that time was
the first treaty between the United States and Prussia-memorable
in the diplomatic annals of the world, and precious as a monument
of the principles, in relation to commerce and maritime warfare,
with which our country entered upon her career as a member of the
great family of independent nations. This treaty, prepared in
conformity with the instructions of the American
plenipotentiaries, consecrated three fundamental principles of
the foreign intercourse which the Congress of that period were
desirous of establishing: First, equal reciprocity and the mutual
stipulation of the privileges of the most favored nation in the
commercial exchanges of peace; secondly, the abolition of private
war upon the ocean, and thirdly, restrictions favorable to
neutral commerce upon belligerent practices with regard to
contraband of war and blockades. A painful, it may be said a
calamitous, experience of more than forty years has demonstrated
the deep importance of these same principles to the peace and
prosperity of this nation and to the welfare of all maritime
States, and has illustrated the profound wisdom with which they
were assumed as cardinal points of the policy of the Union.</p>
<p>At that time in the infancy of their political existence,
under the influence of those principles of liberty and of right
so congenial to the cause in which they had just fought and
triumphed, they were able but to obtain the sanction of one great
and philosophical, though absolute, sovereign in Europe to their
liberal and enlightened principles. They could obtain no more.
Since then a political hurricane has gone over three-fourths of
the civilized portions of the earth, the desolation of which it
may with confidence be expected is passing away, leaving at least
the American atmosphere purified and refreshed. And now at this
propitious moment the new-born nations of this hemisphere,
assembling by their representatives at the 1sthmus between its
two continents to settle the principles of their future
international intercourse with other nations and with us, ask in
this great exigency for our advice upon those very fundamental
maxims which we from our cradle at first proclaimed and partially
succeeded to introduce into the code of national law.</p>
<p>Without recurring to that total prostration of all neutral and
commercial rights which marked the progress of the late European
wars, and which finally involved the United States in them, and
adverting only to our political relations with these American
nations, it is observable that while in all other respects those
relations have been uniformly and without exception of the most
friendly and mutually satisfactory character, the only causes of
difference and dissension between us and them which ever have
arisen originated in those never-failing fountains of discord and
irritation-discriminations of commercial favor to other nations,
licentious privateers, and paper blockades. I can not without
doing injustice to the Republics of Buenos Ayres and Colombia
forbear to acknowledge the candid and conciliatory spirit with
which they have repeatedly yielded to our friendly
representations and remonstrances on these subjects-in repealing
discriminative laws which operated to our disadvantage and in
revoking the commissions of their privateers, to which Colombia
has added the magnanimity of making reparation for unlawful
captures by some of her cruisers and of assenting in the midst of
war to treaty stipulations favorable to neutral navigation. But
the recurrence of these occasions of complaint has rendered the
renewal of the discussions which result in the removal of them
necessary, while in the meantime injuries are sustained by
merchants and other individuals of the United States which can
not be repaired, and the remedy lingers in overtaking the
pernicious operation of the mischief. The settlement of general
principles pervading with equal efficacy all the American States
can alone put an end to these evils, and can alone be
accomplished at the proposed assembly.</p>
<p>If it be true that the noblest treaty of peace ever mentioned
in history is that by which the Carthagenians were bound to
abolish the practice of sacrificing their own children <i>because
it was stipulated in favor of human nature</i>. I can not
exaggerate to myself the unfading glory with which these United
States will go forth in the memory of future ages if by their
friendly counsel, by their moral influence, by the power of
argument and persuasion alone they can prevail upon the American
nations at Panama to stipulate by general agreement among
themselves, and so far as any of them may be concerned, the
perpetual abolition of private war upon the ocean. And if we can
not yet flatter ourselves that this may be accomplished, as
advances toward it the establishment of the principle that the
friendly flag shall cover the cargo, the curtailment of
contraband of war, and the proscription of fictitious paper
blockades-engagements which we may reasonably hope will not prove
impracticable-will, if successfully inculcated, redound
proportionally to our honor and drain the fountain of many a
future sanguinary war.</p>
<p>The late President of the United States, in his message to
Congress of the 2d December, 1823, while announcing the
negotiation then pending with Russia, relating to the northwest
coast of this continent, observed that the occasion of the
discussions to which that incident had given rise had been taken
for asserting as a principle in which the rights and interests of
the United States were involved that the American continents, by
the free and independent condition which they had assumed and
maintained, were thenceforward not to be considered as subjects
for future colonization by any European power. The principle had
first been assumed in that negotiation with Russia. It rested
upon a course of reasoning equally simple and conclusive. With
the exception of the existing European colonies, which it was in
nowise intended to disturb, the two continents consisted of
several sovereign and independent nations, whose territories
covered their whole surface. By this their independent condition
the United States enjoyed the right of commercial intercourse
with every part of their possessions. To attempt the
establishment of a colony in those possessions would be to usurp
to the exclusion of others a commercial intercourse which was the
common possession of all. It could not be done without
encroaching upon existing rights of the United States. The
Government of Russia has never disputed these positions nor
manifested the slightest dissatisfaction at their having been
taken. Most of the new American Republics have declared their
entire assent to them, and they now propose, among the subjects
of consultation at Panama, to take into consideration the means
of making effectual the assertion of that principle, as well as
the means of resisting interference from abroad with the domestic
concerns of the American Governments.</p>
<p>In alluding to these means it would obviously be premature at
this time to anticipate that which is offered merely as matter
for consultation, or to pronounce upon those measures which have
been or may be suggested. The purpose of this Government is to
concur in none which would import hostility to Europe or justly
excite resentment in any of her States. Should it be deemed
advisable to contract any conventional engagement on this topic,
our views would extend no further than to a mutual pledge of the
parties to the compact to maintain the principle in application
to its own territory, and to permit no colonial lodgments or
establishment of European jurisdiction upon its own soil; and
with respect to the obtrusive interference from abroad-if its
future character may be inferred from that which has been and
perhaps still is exercised in more than one of the new States-a
joint declaration of its character and exposure of it to the
world may be probably all that the occasion would require.
Whether the United States should or should not be parties to such
a declaration may justly form a part of the deliberation. That
there is an evil to be remedied heeds little insight into the
secret history of late years to know, and that this remedy may
best be concerted at the Panama meeting deserves at least the
experiment of consideration. A concert of measures having
reference to the more effectual abolition of the African slave
trade and the consideration of the light in which the political
condition of the island of Hayti is to be regarded are also among
the subjects mentioned by the minister from the Republic of
Colombia as believed to be suitable for deliberation at the
congress. The failure of the negotiations with that Republic
undertaken during the late administration, for the suppression of
that trade, in compliance with a resolution of the House of
Representatives, indicates the expediency of listening with
respectful attention to propositions which may contribute to the
accomplishment of the great end which was the purpose of that
resolution, while the result of those negotiations will serve as
admonition to abstain from pledging this Government to any
arrangement which might be expected to fail of obtaining the
advice and consent of the Senate by a constitutional majority to
its ratification.</p>
<p>Whether the political condition of the island of Hayti shall
be brought at all into discussion at the meeting may be a
question for preliminary advisement. There are in the political
constitution of Government of that people circumstances which
have hitherto forbidden the acknowledgment of them by the
Government of the United States as sovereign and independent.
Additional reasons for withholding that acknowledgment have
recently been seen in their acceptance of a nominal sovereignty
by the <i>grant</i> of a foreign prince under conditions
equivalent to the concession by them of exclusive commercial
advantages to one nation, adapted altogether to the state of
colonial vassalage and retaining little of independence but the
name. Our plenipotentiaries will be instructed to present these
views to the assembly at Panama, and should they not be concurred
in to decline acceding to any arrangement which may be proposed
upon different principles.</p>
<p>The condition of the islands of Cuba and Porto Rico is of
deeper import and more immediate bearing upon the present
interests and future prospects of our Union. The correspondence
herewith transmitted will show how earnestly it has engaged the
attention of this Government. The invasion of both those islands
by the united forces of Mexico and Colombia is avowedly among the
objects to be matured by the belligerent States at Panama. The
convulsions to which, from the peculiar composition of their
population, they would be liable in the event of such an
invasion, and the danger therefrom resulting of their falling
ultimately into the hands of some European power other than
Spain, will not admit of our looking at the consequences to which
the congress at Panama may lead with indifference. It is
unnecessary to enlarge upon this topic or to say more than that
all our efforts in reference to this interest will be to preserve
the existing state of things, the tranquillity of the islands,
and the peace and security of their inhabitants.</p>
<p>And lastly, the congress of Panama is believed to present a
fair occasion for urging upon all the new nations of the south
the just and liberal principles of religious liberty; not by any
interference whatever in their internal concerns, but by claiming
for our citizens whose occupations or interests may call them to
occasional residence in their territories the inestimable
privilege of worshipping their Creator according to the dictates
of their own consciences. This privilege, sanctioned by the
customary law of nations and secured by treaty stipulations in
numerous national compacts, secured even to our own citizens in
the treaties with Colombia and with the Federation of Central
America, is yet to be obtained in the other South American States
and Mexico. Existing prejudices are still struggling against it,
which may, perhaps, be more successfully combated at this general
meeting than at the separate seats of Government of each
Republic.</p>
<p>I can scarcely deem it otherwise than superfluous to observe
that the assembly will be in its nature diplomatic and not
legislative; that nothing can be transacted there obligatory upon
any one of the States to be represented at the meeting, unless
with the express concurrence of its own representatives, nor even
then, but subject to the ratification of its constitutional
authority at home. The faith of the United States to foreign
powers can not otherwise be pledged. I shall, indeed, in the
first instance, consider the assembly as merely
<i>consultative</i>; and although the plenipotentiaries of the
United States will be empowered to receive and refer to the
consideration of their Government any proposition from the other
parties to the meeting, they will be authorized to conclude
nothing unless subject to the definitive sanction of this
Government in all its constitutional forms. It has therefore
seemed to me unnecessary to insist that every object to be
discussed at the meeting should be specified with the precision
of a judicial sentence or enumerated with the exactness of a
mathematical demonstration. The purpose of the meeting itself is
to deliberate upon the great and common <i>interests</i> of
several new and neighbouring nations. If the measure is new and
without precedent, so is the situation of the parties to it. That
the purposes of the meeting are somewhat indefinite, far from
being an objection to it is among the cogent reasons for its
adoption. It is not the establishment of principles of
intercourse with one, but with seven or eight nations at once.
That before they have had the means of exchanging ideas and
communicating with one another in common upon these topics they
should have definitively settled and arranged them in concert is
to require that the effect should precede the cause; it is to
exact as a preliminary to the meeting that for the accomplishment
of which the meeting itself is designed.</p>
<p>Among the inquiries which were thought entitled to
consideration before the determination was taken to accept the
invitation was that whether the measure might not have a tendency
to change the policy, hitherto invariably pursued by the United
States, of avoiding all entangling alliances and all unnecessary
foreign connections.</p>
<p>Mindful of the advice given by the father of our country in
his Farewell Address, that the great rule of conduct for us in
regard to foreign nations is, in extending our commercial
relations, to have with them as little political connection as
possible, and faithfully adhering to the spirit of that
admonition, I can not overlook the reflection that the counsel of
Washington in that instance, like all the counsels of wisdom, was
founded upon the circumstances in which our country and the world
around us were situated at the time when it was given; that the
reasons assigned by him for his advice were that Europe had a set
of primary interests which to us had none or a very remote
relation; that hence she must be engaged in frequent
controversies, the, causes of which were essentially foreign to
our concerns; that our <i>detached</i> and <i>distant</i>
situation invited and enabled us to pursue a different course;
that by our union and rapid growth, with an efficient Government,
the period was not far distant when we might defy material injury
from external annoyance, when we might take such an attitude as
would cause our neutrality to be respected, and, with reference
to belligerent nations, might choose peace or war, as our
interests, guided by justice, should counsel.</p>
<p>Compare our situation and the circumstances of that time with
those of the present day, and what, from the very words of
Washington then, would be his counsels to his countrymen now?
Europe has still her set of primary interests, with which we have
little or a remote relation. Our distant and detached situation
with reference to Europe remains the same. But we were then the
only independent nation of this hemisphere, and we were
surrounded by European colonies, with the greater part of which
we had no more intercourse than with the inhabitants of another
planet. Those colonies have now been transformed into eight
independent nations, extending to our very borders, seven of them
Republics like ourselves, with whom we have an immensely growing
commercial, and <i>must</i> have and have already important
political, connections; with reference to whom our situation is
neither distant nor detached; whose political principles and
systems of government, congenial with our own, must and will have
an action and counteraction upon us and ours to which we can not
be indifferent if we would.</p>
<p>The rapidity of our growth, and the consequent increase of our
strength, has more than realized the anticipations of this
admirable political legacy. Thirty years have nearly elapsed
since it was written, and in the interval our population, our
wealth, our territorial extension, our power-physical and
moral-have nearly trebled. Reasoning upon this state of things
from the sound and judicious principles of Washington, must we
not say that the period which he predicted as then not far off
has arrived; that <i>America</i> has a set of primary interests
which have none or a remote relation to Europe; that the
interference of Europe, therefore, in those concerns should be
spontaneously withheld by her upon the same principles that we
have never interfered with hers, and that if she should
interfere, as she may, by measures which may have a great and
dangerous recoil upon ourselves, we might be called in defense of
our own altars and firesides to take an attitude which would
cause our neutrality to be respected, and choose peace or war, as
our interest, guided by justice, should counsel.</p>
<p>The acceptance of this invitation, therefore, far from
conflicting with the counsel or the policy of Washington, is
directly deducible from and conformable to it. Nor is it less
conformable to the views of my immediate predecessor as declared
in his annual message to Congress of the 2d December, 1823, to
which I have already adverted, and to an important passage of
which I invite the attention of the House:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The citizens of the United States (said he) cherish sentiments
the most friendly in favor of the liberty and happiness of their
fellow-men on that (the European) side of the Atlantic. In the
wars of the European powers in matters relating to themselves we
have never taken any part, nor does it comport with our policy so
to do. It is only when our rights are invaded or seriously
menaced that we resent injuries or make preparation for our
defense. With the movements in this hemisphere we are of
hecessity more immediately connected, and by causes which must be
obvious to all enlightened and impartial observers. The political
system of the allied powers is essentially different in this
respect from that of America. This difference proceeds from that
which exists in their respective Governments. And to the defense
of our own, which has been achieved by the loss of so much blood
and treasure, and matured by the wisdom of their most enlightened
citizens, and under which we have enjoyed unexampled felicity,
this whole nation is devoted. We owe it, therefore, to candor and
to the amicable relations subsisting between the United States
and those powers to declare that we should consider any attempt
on their part to extend their system to any portion of this
hemisphere as dangerous to our peace and safety. With the
existing colonies or dependencies of any European power we have
not interfered and shall not interfere; but with the Governments
who have declared their independence and maintained it, and whose
independence we have on great consideration and on just
principles acknowledged, we could not view any interposition for
the purposes of oppressing them or controlling in any other
manner their destiny by any European power in any other light
than as the manifestation of an unfriendly disposition toward the
United States. In the war between those new Governments and Spain
we declared our neutrality at the time of their recognition, and
to this we have adhered and shall continue to adhere, provided no
change shall occur which in the judgment of the competent
authorities of this Government shall make a corresponding change
on the part of the United States indispensable to their
security.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To the question which may be asked, whether this meeting and
the principles which may be adjusted and settled by it as rules
of intercourse between the American nations may not give umbrage
to the holy league of European powers or offense to Spain, it is
deemed a sufficient answer that our attendance at Panama can give
<i>no just cause</i> of umbrage or offense to either, and that
the United States will stipulate nothing there which can give
such cause. Here the right of inquiry into our purposes and
measures must stop. The holy league of Europe itself was formed
without inquiring of the United States whether it would or would
not give umbrage to them. The fear of giving umbrage to the holy
league of Europe was urged as a motive for denying to the
American nations the acknowledgment of their independence. That
it would be viewed by Spain as hostility to her was not only
urged, but directly declared by herself. The Congress and
administration of that day consulted their rights and duties, and
not their fears. Fully determined to give no heedless displeasure
to any foreign power, the United States can estimate the
probability of their giving it only by the right which any
foreign state could have to take it from their measures. Neither
the representation of the United States at Panama nor any measure
to which their assent may be yielded there will give to the holy
league or any of its members, nor to Spain, the right to take
offense; for the rest the United States must still, as
heretofore, take counsel from their duties rather than their
fears.</p>
<p>Such are the objects in which it is expected that the
plenipotentiaries of the United States, when commissioned to
attend the meeting at the Isthmus, will take part, and such are
the motives and purposes with which the invitation of the three
Republics was accepted. It was, however, as the House will
perceive from the correspondence, accepted only upon condition
that the nomination of commissioners for the mission should
receive the advice and consent of the Senate.</p>
<p>The concurrence of the House to the measure by the
appropriations necessary for carrying it into effect is alike
subject to its free determination and indispensable to the
fulfillment of the intention.</p>
<p>That the congress at Panama will accomplish all, or even any,
of the transcendent benefits to the human race which warmed the
conceptions of its first proposer it were perhaps indulging too
sanguine a forecast of events to promise. It is in its nature a
measure speculative and experimental. The blessing of Heaven may
turn it to the account of human improvement; accidents unforeseen
and mischances not to be anticipated may baffle all its high
purposes and disappoint its fairest expectations. But the design
is great, is benevolent, is humane.</p>
<p>It looks to the melioration of the condition of man. It is
congenial with that spirit which prompted the declaration of our
independence, which inspired the preamble of our first treaty
with France, which dictated our first treaty with Prussia and the
instructions under which it was negotiated, which filled the
hearts and fired the souls of the immortal founders of our
Revolution.</p>
<p>With this unrestricted exposition of the motives by which I
have been governed in this transaction, as well as of the objects
to be discussed and of the ends, if possible, to be attained by
our representation at the proposed congress, I submit the
propriety of an appropriation to the candid consideration and
enlightened patriotism of the Legislature.</p>

<p><br>
 Washington,<br>
 <i>March 30, 1826</i>.</p>
<p><i>To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States</i>:</p>
<p>By the second article of the general convention of peace,
amity, navigation, and commerce between the United States and the
Republic of Colombia, concluded at Bogota on 3d of October, 1824,
it was stipulated that the parties engaged mutually not to grant
any particular favor to other nations in respect of commerce and
navigation which should not immediately become common to the
other party, who should enjoy the same freely if the concession
was freely made, or on allowing the same compensation if the
concession was conditional. And in the third article of the same
convention it was agreed that the citizens of the United States
might frequent all the coasts and countries of the Republic of
Colombia, and reside and trade there in all sorts of produce,
manufactures, and merchandise, and should pay no other or greater
duties, charges, or fees whatsoever than the most favored nation
should be obliged to pay, and should enjoy all the rights,
privileges, and exemptions in navigation and commerce which the
most favored nations should enjoy, submitting themselves,
nevertheless, to the laws, decrees, and usages there established,
and to which were submitted the subjects and citizens of the most
favored nations; with a reciprocal stipulation in favor of the
citizens of the Republic of Colombia in the United States.
Subsequently to the conclusion of this convention a treaty was
negotiated between the Republic of Colombia and Great Britain, by
which it was stipulated that no other or higher duties on account
of tonnage, light, or harbor dues should be imposed in the ports
of Colombia on British vessels than those payable in the same
ports by Colombian vessels, and that the same duties should be
paid on the importation into the territories of Colombia of any
article the growth, produce, or manufacture of His Britannic
Majesty's dominions, whether such importations should be in
Colombian or in British vessels, and that the same duties should
be paid and the same discount (drawbacks) and bounties allowed on
the exportation of any articles the growth, produce, or
manufacture of Colombia to His Britannic Majesty's dominions,
whether such exportations were in Colombian or in British
vessels.</p>
<p>The minister of the United States to the Republic of Colombia
having claimed, by virtue of the second and third articles of the
convention between the two Republics, that the benefit of these
subsequent stipulations should be alike extended to the citizens
of the United States upon the condition of reciprocity provided
for by the convention, the application of those engagements was
readily acceded to by the Colombian Government, and a decree was
issued by the executive authority of that Republic on the 30th of
January last, a copy and translation of which are herewith
communicated, securing to the citizens of the United States in
the Republic of Colombia the same advantages in regard to
commerce and navigation which had been conceded to British
subjects in the Colombian treaty with Great Britain.</p>
<p>It remains for the Government of the United States to secure
to the citizens of the Republic of Colombia the reciprocal
advantages to which they are entitled by the terms of the
convention, to commence from the 30th of January last, for the
accomplishment of which I invite the favor-able consideration of
the Legislature.</p>

from the Secretary of State, with the documents desired by the

<p><i>To the Senate of the United States</i>:</p>
<p>On the 16th of January last I sent to the Senate a nomination
of Daniel Bissell to be colonel of the Second Regiment of
Artillery, and on the 3d of February I received from the
Secretary of the Senate an attested copy of their proceedings in
relation to that nomination, laid before me by their order, and
closing with a resolution in these words:</p>
<p><i>Resolved</i>. That in the opinion of the Senate Daniel
Bissell is entitled to the place of colonel in the Army of the
United States, taking rank as such from the 15th of August, 1812,
with the brevet of brigadier-general from the 9th of March, 1814,
and that the President of the United States may arrange him
accordingly.</p>
<p>In the discharge of my own duties I am under the hecessity of
stating respectfully to the Senate-</p>
<p>First. That I can not concur in these opinions.</p>
<p>Secondly. That the resolution of the Senate, having on its
face no reference either to the nomination or to the office for
which it was made, leaves me doubtful whether it was intended by
the Senate as their decision upon the nomination or not. If
intended as their decision, it imports that the Senate do not
advise and consent to the appointment of Daniel Bissell as
colonel in the Second Regiment of Artillery. If intended as a
mere expression of their opinions, superseding in their judgment
the hecessity of their immediate decision upon the nomination, it
leaves the Senate still in possession of the nomination and free
to act upon it when informed of my inability to carry those
opinions into effect.</p>
<p>In this uncertainty I have thought it most respectful to the
Senate to refer the subject again to them for their
consideration. The delay in the transmission of this
communication is attributable to the earnest desire which I have
entertained of acceding to the opinions and complying with the
wishes of the Senate, and to the long and repeated
reconsideration of my own impressions with the view to make them,
if possible, conform to theirs. A still higher duty now
constrains me to invite their definitive decision upon the
nomination.</p>

<h2>EXECUTIVE ORDER.</h2>
<p><br>
 Adjutant-General's Office,</p>
<p><br>
 Washington,<br>
 <i>July 11, 1826</i></p>
<br>
<br>

<p>General Orders.</p>
<p>The General in Chief has received from the Department of War
the following orders:</p>
<p>The President with deep regret announces to the Army that it
has pleased the Disposer of All Human Events, in whose hands are
the issues of life, to remove from the scene of earthly existence
our illustrious and venerated fellow-citizen, Thomas
Jefferson.</p>
<p>This dispensation of Divine Providence, afflicting to us, but
the consummation of glory to him, occurred on the 4th of the
present month--- on the fiftieth anniversary of that Independence
the Declaration of which, emanating from his mind, at once
proclaimed the birth of a free nation and offered motives of hope
and consolation to the whole family of man. Sharing in the grief
which every heart must feel for so heavy and afflicting a public
loss, and desirous to express his high sense of the vast debt of
gratitude which is due to the virtues, talents, and
ever-memorable services of the illustrious deceased, the
President directs that funeral honors be paid to him at all the
military stations, and that the officers of the Army wear crape
on the left arm, by way of mourning, for six months.</p>
<p>Major-General Brown will give the necessary orders for
carrying into effect the foregoing directions.</p>
<p>J. Barbour.</p>
<br>

<hr class="c3">
<br>
<br>

<p>It has become the painful duty of the Secretary of War to
announce to the Army the death of another distinguished and
venerated citizen. John Adams departed this life on the 4th of
this month. Like his compatriot Jefferson, he aided in drawing
and ably supporting the Declaration of Independence. With a
prophetic eye he looked through the impending difficulties of the
Revolution and foretold with what demonstrations of joy the
anniversary of the birth of American freedom would be hailed. He
was permitted to behold the verification of his prophecy, and
died, as did Jefferson, on the day of the jubilee.</p>
<p>A coincidence of circumstances so wonderful gives confidence
to the belief that the patriotic efforts of these illustrious men
were Heaven directed, and furnishes a new seal to the hope that
the prosperity of these States is under the special protection of
a kind Providence.</p>
<p>The Secretary of War directs that the same funeral honors be
paid by the Army to the memory of the deceased as by the order of
the 7th (11th?) instant were directed to be paid to Thomas
Jefferson, and the same token of mourning be worn.</p>
<p>Major-General Brown is charged with the execution of this
order.</p>
<p>J. Barbour.</p>
<br>

<hr class="c3">
<br>
<br>

<p>Never has it fallen to the lot of any commander to announce to
an army such an event as now calls forth the mingled grief and
astonishment of this Republic; never since history first wrote
the record of time has one day thus mingled every triumphant with
every tender emotion, and consecrated a nation's joy by blending
it with the most sacred of sorrows. Yes, soldiers, in one day,
almost in the same hour, have two of the Founders of the
Republic, the Patriarchs of Liberty, closed their services to
social man, after beholding them crowned with the richest and
most unlimited success. United in their end as they had been in
their highest aim, their toils completed, their hopes surpassed,
their honors full, and the dearest wish of their bosoms gratified
in death, they closed their eyes in patriot ecstasy, amidst the
gratulations and thanksgivings of a people on all, on every
individual, of whom they had conferred the best of all earthly
benefits.</p>
<p>Such men heed no trophies; they ask no splendid mausolea. We
are their monuments; their mausolea is their country, and her
growing prosperity the amaranthine wreath that Time shall place
over their dust. Well may the Genius of the Republic mourn. If
she turns her eyes in one direction, she beholds the hall where
Jefferson wrote the charter of her rights; if in another, she
sees the city where Adams kindled the fires of the Revolution. To
no period of our history, to no department of our affairs, can
she direct her views and not meet the multiplied memorials of her
loss and of their glory.</p>
<p>At the grave of such men envy dies, and party animosity
blushes while she quenches her fires. If Science and Philosophy
lament their enthusiastic votary in the halls of Monticello,
Philanthropy and Eloquence weep with no less reason in the
retirement of Quincy. And when hereafter the stranger performing
his pilgrimage to the land of freedom shall ask for the monument
of Jefferson, his inquiring eye may be directed to the dome of
that temple of learning, the university of his native State---
the last labor of his untiring mind, the latest and the favorite
gift of a patriot to his country.</p>
<p>Bereaved yet happy America! Mourning yet highly favored
country! Too happy if every son whose loss shall demand thy tears
can thus soothe thy sorrow by a legacy of fame.</p>
<p>The Army of the United States, devoted to the service of the
country, and honoring all who are alike devoted, whether in the
Cabihet or the field, will feel an honorable and a melancholy
pride in obeying this order. Let the officers, then, wear the
badge of mourning, the poor emblem of a sorrow which words can
not express, but which freemen must ever feel while contemplating
the graves of the venerated Fathers of the Republic.</p>
<p>Tuesday succeeding the arrival of this order at each military
station shall be a day of rest.</p>
<p>The National flag shall wave at half-mast.</p>
<p>At early dawn thirteen guns shall be fired, and at intervals
of thirty minutes between the rising and setting sun a single
cannon will be discharged, and at the close of the day
twenty-four rounds.</p>

<p>SECOND ANNUAL MESSAGE.</p>
<p><br>
 Washington,<br>
 <i>December 5, 1826</i>.<br>
</p>
<p><i>Fellow-Citizens of the Senate and of the House of
Representatives</i>:</p>
<p>The assemblage of the representatives of our Union in both
Houses of the Congress at this time occurs under circumstances
calling for the renewed homage of our grateful acknowledgments to
the Giver of All Good. With the exceptions incidental to the most
felicitous condition of human existence, we continue to be highly
favored in all the elements which contribute to individual
comfort and to national prosperity. In the survey of our
extensive country we have generally to observe abodes of health
and regions of plenty. In our civil and political relations we
have peace without and tranquillity within our borders. We are,
as a people, increasing with unabated rapidity in population,
wealth, and national resources, and whatever differences of
opinion exist among us with regard to the mode and the means by
which we shall turn the beneficence of Heaven to the improvement
of our own condition, there is yet a spirit animating us all
which will not suffer the bounties of Providence to be showered
upon us in vain, but will receive them with grateful hearts, and
apply them with unwearied hands to the advancement of the general
good.</p>
<p>Of the subjects recommended to Congress at their last session,
some were then definitively acted upon. Others, left unfinished,
but partly matured, will recur to your attention without heeding
a renewal of notice from me. The purpose of this communication
will be to present to your view the general aspect of our public
affairs at this moment and the measures which have been taken to
carry into effect the intentions of the Legislature as signified
by the laws then and heretofore enacted.</p>
<p>In our intercourse with the other nations of the earth we have
still the happiness of enjoying peace and a general good
understanding, qualified, however, in several important instances
by collisions of interest and by unsatisfied claims of justice,
to the settlement of which the constitutional interposition of
the legislative authority may become ultimately
indispensable.</p>
<p>By the decease of the Emperor Alexander, of Russia, which
occurred contemporaneously with the commencement of the last
session of Congress, the United States have been deprived of a
long-tried, steady, and faithful friend. Born to the inheritance
of absolute power and trained in the school of adversity, from
which no power on earth, however absolute, is exempt, that
monarch from his youth had been taught to feel the force and
value of public opinion and to be sensible that the interests of
his own Government would best be promoted by a frank and friendly
intercourse with this Republic, as those of his people would be
advanced by a liberal commercial intercourse with our country. A
candid and confidential interchange of sentiments between him and
the Government of the United States upon the affairs of Southern
America took place at a period not long preceding his demise, and
contributed to fix that course of policy which left to the other
Governments of Europe no alternative but that of sooner or later
recognizing the independence of our southern neighbors, of which
the example had by the United States already been set. The
ordinary diplomatic communications between his successor, the
Emperor Nicholas, and the United States have suffered some
interruption by the illness, departure, and subsequent decease of
his minister residing here, who enjoyed, as he merited, the
entire confidence of his new sovereign, as he had eminently
responded to that of his predecessor. But we have had the most
satisfactory assurances that the sentiments of the reigning
Emperor toward the United States are altogether conformable to
those which had so long and constantly animated his imperial
brother, and we have reason to hope that they will serve to
cement that harmony and good understanding between the two
nations which, founded in congenial interests, can not but result
in the advancement of the welfare and prosperity of both.</p>
<p>Our relations of commerce and navigation with France are, by
the operation of the convention of 24th of June, 1822, with that
nation, in a state of gradual and progressive improvement.
Convinced by all our experience, no less than by the principles
of fair and liberal reciprocity which the United States have
constantly tendered to all the nations of the earth as the rule
of commercial intercourse which they would universally prefer,
that fair and equal competition is most conducive to the
interests of both parties, the United States in the negotiation
of that convention earnestly contended for a mutual renunciation
of discriminating duties and charges in the ports of the two
countries. Unable to obtain the immediate recognition of this
principle in its full extent, after reducing the duties of
discrimination so far as was found attainable it was agreed that
at the expiration of two years from the 1st of October, 1822,
when the convention was to go into effect, unless a notice of six
months on either side should be given to the other that the
convention itself must terminate, those duties should be reduced
one-fourth, and that this reduction should be yearly repeated,
until all discrimination should cease, while the convention
itself should continue in force. By the effect of this
stipulation three-fourths of the discriminating duties which had
been levied by each party upon the vessels of the other in its
ports have already been removed; and on the 1st of next October,
should the convention be still in force, the remaining fourth
will be discontinued. French vessels laden with French produce
will be received in our ports on the same terms as our own, and
ours in return will enjoy the same advantages in the ports of
France.</p>
<p>By these approximations to an equality of duties and of
charges not only has the commerce between the two countries
prospered, but friendly dispositions have been on both sides
encouraged and promoted. They will continue to be cherished and
cultivated on the part of the United States. It would have been
gratifying to have had it in my power to add that the claims upon
the justice of the French Government, involving the property and
the comfortable subsistence of many of our fellow-citizens, and
which have been so long and so earnestly urged, were in a more
promising train of adjustment than at your last meeting; but
their condition remains unaltered.</p>
<p>With the Government of the Netherlands the mutual abandonment
of discriminating duties had been regulated by legislative acts
on both sides. The act of Congress of the 20th of April, 1818,
abolished all discriminating duties of impost and tonnage upon
the vessels and produce of the Netherlands in the ports of the
United States upon the assurance given by the Government of the
Netherlands that all such duties operating against the shipping
and commerce of the United States in that Kingdom had been
abolished. These reciprocal regulations had continued in force
several years when the discriminating principle was resumed by
the Netherlands in a new and indirect form by a bounty of 10 per
cent in the shape of a return of duties to their national
vessels, and in which those of the United States are not
permitted to participate. By the act of Congress of 7th January,
1824, all discriminating duties in the United States were again
suspended, so far as related to the vessels and produce of the
Netherlands, so long as the reciprocal exemption should be
extended to the vessels and produce of the United States in the
Netherlands. But the same act provides that in the event of a
restoration of discriminating duties to operate against the
shipping and commerce of the United States in any of the foreign
countries referred to therein the suspension of discriminating
duties in favor of the navigation of such foreign country should
cease and all the provisions of the acts imposing discriminating
foreign tonnage and impost duties in the United States should
revive and be in full force with regard to that nation.</p>
<p>In the correspondence with the Government of the Netherlands
upon this subject they have contended that the favor shown to
their own shipping by this bounty upon their tonnage is not to be
considered as a discriminating duty; but it can not be denied
that it produces all the same effects. Had the mutual abolition
been stipulated by treaty, such a bounty upon the national
vessels could scarcely have been granted consistently with good
faith. Yet as the act of Congress of 7th January, 1824, has not
expressly authorized the Executive authority to determine what
shall be considered as a revival of discriminating duties by a
foreign government to the disadvantage of the United States, and
as the retaliatory measure on our part, however just and
necessary, may tend rather to that conflict of legislation which
we deprecate than to that concert to which we invite all
commercial nations, as most conducive to their interest and our
own, I have thought it more consistent with the spirit of our
institutions to refer the subject again to the paramount
authority of the Legislature to decide what measure the emergency
may require than abruptly by proclamation to carry into effect
the minatory provisions of the act of 1824.</p>
<p>During the last session of Congress treaties of amity,
navigation, and commerce were negotiated and signed at this place
with the Government of Denmark, in Europe, and with the
Federation of Central America, in this hemisphere. These treaties
then received the constitutional sanction of the Senate, by the
advice and consent to their ratification. They were accordingly
ratified on the part of the United States, and during the recess
of Congress have been also ratified by the other respective
contracting parties. The ratifications have been exchanged, and
they have been published by proclamations, copies of which are
herewith communicated to Congress.</p>
<p>These treaties have established between the contracting
parties the principles of equality and reciprocity in their
broadest and most liberal extent, each party admitting the
vessels of the other into its ports, laden with cargoes the
produce or manufacture of any quarter of the globe, upon the
payment of the same duties of tonnage and impost that are
chargeable upon their own. They have further stipulated that the
parties shall hereafter grant no favor of navigation or commerce
to any other nation which shall not upon the same terms be
granted to each other, and that neither party will impose upon
articles of merchandise the produce or manufacture of the other
any other or higher duties than upon the like articles being the
produce or manufacture of any other country. To these principles
there is in the convention with Denmark an exception with regard
to the colonies of that Kingdom in the arctic seas, but none with
regard to her colonies in the West Indies.</p>
<p>In the course of the last summer the term to which our last
commercial treaty with Sweden was limited has expired. A
continuation of it is in the contemplation of the Swedish
Government, and is believed to be desirable on the part of the
United States. It has been proposed by the King of Sweden that
pending the negotiation of renewal the expired treaty should be
mutually considered as still in force, a measure which will
require the sanction of Congress to be carried into effect on our
part, and which I therefore recommend to your consideration.</p>
<p>With Prussia, Spain, Portugal, and, in general, all the
European powers between whom and the United States relations of
friendly intercourse have existed their condition has not
materially varied since the last session of Congress. I regret
not to be able to say the same of our commercial intercourse with
the colonial possessions of Great Britain in America.
Negotiations of the highest importance to our common interests
have been for several years in discussion between the two
Governments, and on the part of the United States have been
invariably pursued in the spirit of candor and conciliation.
Interests of great magnitude and delicacy had been adjusted by
the conventions of 1815 and 1818, while that of 1822, mediated by
the late Emperor Alexander, had promised a satisfactory
compromise of claims which the Government of the United States,
in justice to the rights of a numerous class of their citizens,
was bound to sustain. But with regard to the commercial
intercourse between the United States and the British colonies in
America, it has been hitherto found impracticable to bring the
parties to an understanding satisfactory to both. The relative
geographical position and the respective products of nature
cultivated by human industry had constituted the elements of a
commercial intercourse between the United States and British
America, insular and continental, important to the inhabitants of
both countries; but it had been interdicted by Great Britain upon
a principle heretofore practiced upon by the colonizing nations
of Europe, of holding the trade of their colonies each in
exclusive monopoly to herself. After the termination of the late
war this interdiction had been revived, and the British
Government declined including this portion of our intercourse
with her possessions in the negotiation of the convention of
1815. The trade was then carried on exclusively in British
vessels till the act of Congress, concerning navigation, of 1818
and the supplemental act of 1820 met the interdict by a
corresponding measure on the part of the United States. These
measures, not of retaliation, but of necessary self-defense, were
soon succeeded by an act of Parliament opening certain colonial
ports to the vessels of the United States coming directly from
them, and to the importation from them of certain articles of our
produce burdened with heavy duties, and excluding some of the
most valuable articles of our exports. The United States opened
their ports to British vessels from the colonies upon terms as
exactly corresponding with those of the act of Parliament as in
the relative position of the parties could be made, and a
negotiation was commenced by mutual consent, with the hope on our
part that a reciprocal spirit of accommodation and a common
sentiment of the importance of the trade to the interests of the
inhabitants of the two countries between whom it must be carried
on would ultimately bring the parties to a compromise with which
both might be satisfied. With this view the Government of the
United States had determined to sacrifice something of that
entire reciprocity which in all commercial arrangements with
foreign powers they are entitled to demand, and to acquiesce in
some inequalities disadvantageous to ourselves rather than to
forego the benefit of a final and permanent adjustment of this
interest to the satisfaction of Great Britain herself. The
negotiation, repeatedly suspended by accidental circumstances,
was, however, by mutual agreement and express assent, considered
as pending and to be speedily resumed. In the meantime another
act of Parliament, so doubtful and ambiguous in its import as to
have been misunderstood by the officers in the colonies who were
to carry it into execution, opens again certain colonial ports
upon new conditions and terms, with a threat to close them
against any nation which may not accept those terms as prescribed
by the British Government. This act, passed in July, 1825, not
communicated to the Government of the United States, not
understood by the British officers of the customs in the colonies
where it was to be enforced, was nevertheless submitted to the
consideration of Congress at their last session. With the
knowledge that a negotiation upon the subject had long been in
progress and pledges given of its resumption at an early day, it
was deemed expedient to await the result of that negotiation
rather than to subscribe implicitly to terms the import of which
was not clear and which the British authorities themselves in
this hemisphere were not prepared to explain.</p>
<p>Immediately after the close of the last session of Congress
one of our most distinguished citizens was dispatched as envoy
extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary to Great Britain,
furnished with instructions which we could not doubt would lead
to a conclusion of this long-controverted interest upon terms
acceptable to Great Britain. Upon his arrival, and before he had
delivered his letters of credence, he was met by an order of the
British council excluding from and after the 1st of December now
current the vessels of the United States from all the colonial
British ports excepting those immediately bordering on our
territories. In answer to his expostulations upon a measure thus
unexpected he is informed that according to the ancient maxims of
policy of European nations having colonies their trade is an
exclusive possession of the mother country; that all
participation in it by other nations is a boon or favor not
forming a subject of negotiation, but to be regulated by the
legislative acts of the power owning the colony; that the British
Government therefore declines negotiating concerning it, and that
as the United States did not forthwith accept purely and simply
the terms offered by the act of Parliament of July, 1825, Great
Britain would not now admit the vessels of the United States even
upon the terms on which she has opened them to the navigation of
other nations.</p>
<p>We have been accustomed to consider the trade which we have
enjoyed with the British colonies rather as an interchange of
mutual benefits than as a mere favor received; that under every
circumstance we have given an ample equivalent. We have seen
every other nation holding colonies negotiate with other nations
and grant them freely admission to the colonies by treaty, and so
far are the other colonizing nations of Europe now from refusing
to negotiate for trade with their colonies that we ourselves have
secured access to the colonies of more than one of them by
treaty. The refusal, however, of Great Britain to negotiate
leaves to the United States no other alternative than that of
regulating or interdicting altogether the trade on their part,
according as either measure may affect the interests of our own
country, and with that exclusive object I would recommend the
whole subject to your calm and candid deliberations.</p>
<p>It is hoped that our unavailing exertions to accomplish a
cordial good understanding on this interest will not have an
unpropitious* effect upon the other great topics of discussion
between the two Governments. Our northeastern and northwestern
boundaries are still unadjusted. The commissioners under the
seventh article of the treaty of Ghent have nearly come to the
close of their labors; nor can we renounce the expectation,
enfeebled as it is, that they may agree upon their report to the
satisfaction or acquiescence of both parties. The commission for
liquidating the claims for indemnity for slaves carried away
after the close of the war has been sitting, with doubtful
prospects of success. Propositions of compromise have, however,
passed between the two Governments, the result of which we
flatter ourselves may yet prove satisfactory. Our own
dispositions and purposes toward Great Britain are all friendly
and conciliatory; nor can we abandon but with strong reluctance
the belief that they will ultimately meet a return, not of
favors, which we neither ask nor desire, but of equal reciprocity
and good will.</p>
<p>With the American Governments of this hemisphere we continue
to maintain an intercourse altogether friendly, and between their
nations and ours that commercial interchange of which mutual
benefit is the source and mutual comfort and harmony the result
is in a continual state of improvement. The war between Spain and
them since the total expulsion of the Spanish military force from
their continental territories has been little more than nominal,
and their internal tranquillity, though occasionally menaced by
the agitations which civil wars never fail to leave behind them,
has not been affected by any serious calamity.</p>
<p>The congress of ministers from several of those nations which
assembled at Panama, after a short session there, adjourned to
meet again at a more favorable season in the neighbourhood of
Mexico. The decease of one of our ministers on his way to the
Isthmus, and the impediments of the season, which delayed the
departure of the other, deprived us of the advantage of being
represented at the first meeting of the congress. There is,
however, no reason to believe that any of the transactions of the
congress were of a nature to affect injuriously the interests of
the United States or to require the interposition of our
ministers had they been present. Their absence has, indeed,
deprived us of the opportunity of possessing precise and
authentic information of the treaties which were concluded at
Panama; and the whole result has confirmed me in the conviction
of the expediency to the United States of being represented at
the congress. The surviving member of the mission, appointed
during your last session, has accordingly proceeded to his
destination, and a successor to his distinguished and lamented
associate will be nominated to the Senate. A treaty of amity,
navigation, and commerce has in the course of the last summer
been concluded by our minister plenipotentiary at Mexico with the
united states of that Confederacy, which will also be laid before
the Senate for their advice with regard to its ratification.</p>
<p>In adverting to the present condition of our fiscal concerns
and to the prospects of our revenue the first remark that calls
our attention is that they are less exuberantly prosperous than
they were at the corresponding period of the last year. The
severe shock so extensively sustained by the commercial and
manufacturing interests in Great Britain has not been without a
perceptible recoil upon ourselves. A reduced importation from
abroad is necessarily succeeded by a reduced return to the
Treasury at home. The net revenue of the present year will not
equal that of the last, and the receipts of that which is to come
will fall short of those in the current year. The diminution,
however, is in part attributable to the flourishing condition of
some of our domestic manufactures, and so far is compensated by
an equivalent more profitable to the nation. It is also highly
gratifying to perceive that the deficiency in the revenue, while
it scarcely exceeds the anticipations of the last year's estimate
from the Treasury, has not interrupted the application of more
than eleven millions during the present year to the discharge of
the principal and interest of the debt, nor the reduction of
upward of seven millions of the capital of the debt itself. The
balance in the Treasury on the 1st of January last was
$5,201,650.43; the receipts from that time to the 30th of
September last were $19,585,932.50; the receipts of the current
quarter, estimated at $6,000,000. yield, with the sums already
received, a revenue of about twenty-five millions and a half for
the year; the expenditures for the three first quarters of the
year have amounted to $18,714,226.66; the expenditures of the
current quarter are expected, including the two millions of the
principal of the debt to be paid, to balance the receipts; so
that the expenses of the year, amounting to upward of a million
less than its income, will leave a proportionally increased
balance in the Treasury on the 1st of January, 1827, over that of
the 1st of January last; instead of $5,200,000 there will be
$6,400,000.</p>
<p>The amount of duties secured on merchandise imported from the
commencement of the year till September 30 is estimated at
$21,250,000, and the amount that will probably accrue during the
present quarter is estimated at $4,250,000, making for the whole
year $25,500,000, from which the drawbacks being deducted will
leave a clear revenue from the customs receivable in the year
1827 of about $20,400,000, which, with the sums to be received
from the proceeds of public lands, the bank dividends, and other
incidental receipts, will form an aggregate of about $23,000,000,
a sum falling short of the whole expenses of the present year
little more than the portion of those expenditures applied to the
discharge of the public debt beyond the annual appropriation of
$10,000,000 by the act of the 3d March, 1817. At the passage of
that act the public debt amounted to $123,500,000. On the 1st of
January next it will be short of $74,000,000. In the lapse of
these ten years $50,000,000 of public debt, with the annual
charge of upward of $3,000,000 of interest upon them, have been
extinguished. At the passage of that act, of the annual
appropriation of ten millions seven were absorbed in the payment
of interest, and not more than three millions went to reduce the
capital of the debt. Of the same ten millions, at this time
scarcely four are applicable to the interest, and upward of six
are effective in melting down the capital. Yet our experience has
proved that a revenue consisting so largely of imposts and
tonnage ebbs and flows to an extraordinary extent, with all the
fluctuations incident to the general commerce of the world. It is
within our recollection that even in the compass of the same last
ten years the receipts of the Treasury were not adequate to the
expenditures of the year, and that in two successive years it was
found necessary to resort to loans to meet the engagements of the
nation. The returning tides of the succeeding years replenished
the public coffers until they have again begun to feel the
vicissitude of a decline. To produce these alternations of
fullness and exhaustion the relative operation of abundant or
unfruitful seasons, the regulations of foreign governments,
political revolutions, the prosperous or decaying condition of
manufactures, commercial speculations, and many other causes, not
always to be traced, variously combine. We have found the
alternate swells and diminutions embracing periods of from two to
three years. The last period of depression to us was from 1819 to
1822. The corresponding revival was from 1823 to the commencement
of the present year. Still, we have no cause to apprehend a
depression comparable to that of the former period, or even to
anticipate a deficiency which will intrench upon the ability to
apply the annual ten millions to the reduction of the debt. It is
well for us, however, to be admonished of the hecessity of
abiding by the maxims of the most vigilant economy, and of
resorting to all honorable and useful expedients for pursuing
with steady and inflexible perseverance the total discharge of
the debt.</p>
<p>Besides the seven millions of the loans of 1813 which will
have been discharged in the course of the present year, there are
nine millions which by the terms of the contracts would have been
and are now redeemable. Thirteen millions more of the loan of
1814 will become redeemable from and after the expiration of the
present month, and nine other millions from and after the close
of the ensuing year. They constitute a mass of $31,000,000, all
bearing an interest of 6 per cent, more than twenty millions of
which will be immediately redeemable, and the rest within little
more than a year. Leaving of this amount fifteen millions to
continue at the interest of 6 per cent, but to be paid off as far
as shall be found practicable in the years 1827 and 1828, there
is scarcely a doubt that the remaining sixteen millions might
within a few months be discharged by a loan at not exceeding 5
per cent, redeemable in the years 1829 and 1830. By this
operation a sum of nearly half a million of dollars may be saved
to the nation, and the discharge of the whole thirty-one millions
within the four years may be greatly facilitated if not wholly
accomplished.</p>
<p>By an act of Congress of 3d March, 1835,* a loan for the
purpose now referred to, or a subscription to stock, was
authorized, at an interest not exceeding 4-1/2 per cent. But at
that time so large a portion of the floating capital of the
country was absorbed in commercial speculations and so little was
left for investment in the stocks that the measure was but
partially successful. At the last session of Congress the
condition of the funds was still unpropitious to the measure; but
the change so soon afterwards occurred that, had the authority
existed to redeem the nine millions now redeemable by an exchange
of stocks or a loan at 5 per cent, it is morally certain that it
might have been effected, and with it a yearly saving of
$90,000.</p>
<p>With regard to the collection of the revenue of imposts,
certain occurrences have within the last year been disclosed in
one or two of our principal ports, which engaged the attention of
Congress at their last session and may hereafter require further
consideration. Until within a very few years the execution of the
laws for raising the revenue, like that of all our other laws,
has been insured more by the moral sense of the community than by
the rigors of a jealous precaution or by penal sanctions.
Confiding in the exemplary punctuality and unsullied integrity of
our importing merchants, a gradual relaxation from the provisions
of the collection laws, a close adherence to which would have
caused inconvenience and expense to them, had long become
habitual, and indulgences had been extended universally because
they had never been abused. It may be worthy of your serious
consideration whether some further legislative provision may not
be necessary to come in aid of this state of unguarded
security.</p>
<p>From the reports herewith communicated of the Secretaries of
War and of the Navy, with the subsidiary documents annexed to
them, will be discovered the present condition and administration
of our military establishment on the land and on the sea. The
organization of the Army having undergone no change since its
reduction to the present peace establishment in 1821, it remains
only to observe that it is yet found adequate to all the purposes
for which a permanent armed force in time of peace can be heeded
or useful. It may be proper to add that, from a difference of
opinion between the late President of the United States and the
Senate with regard to the construction of the act of Congress of
2d March, 1821, to reduce and fix the military peace
establishment of the United States, it remains hitherto so far
without execution that no colonel has been appointed to command
one of the regiments of artillery. A supplementary or explanatory
act of the Legislature appears to be the only expedient
practicable for removing the difficulty of this appointment.</p>
<p>In a period of profound peace the conduct of the mere military
establishment forms but a very inconsiderable portion of the
duties devolving upon the administration of the Department of
War. It will be seen by the returns from the subordinate
departments of the Army that every branch of the service is
marked with order, regularity, and discipline; that from the
commanding general through all the gradations of superintendence
the officers feel themselves to have been citizens before they
were soldiers, and that the glory of a republican army must
consist in the spirit of freedom, by which it is animated, and of
patriotism, by which it is impelled. It may be confidently stated
that the moral character of the Army is in a state of continual
improvement, and that all the arrangements for the disposal of
its parts have a constant reference to that end.</p>
<p>But to the War Department are attributed other duties, having,
indeed, relation to a future possible condition of war, but being
purely defensive, and in their tendency contributing rather to
the security and permanency of peace-the erection of the
fortifications provided for by Congress, and adapted to secure
our shores from hostile invasion; the distribution of the fund of
public gratitude and justice to the pensioners of the
Revolutionary war; the maintenance of our relations of peace and
of protection with the Indian tribes, and the internal
improvements and surveys for the location of roads and canals,
which during the last three sessions of Congress have engaged so
much of their attention, and may engross so large a share of
their future benefactions to our country.</p>
<p>By the act of the 30th of April, 1824, suggested and approved
by my predecessor, the sum of $30,000 was appropriated for the
purpose of causing to be made the necessary surveys, plans, and
estimates of the routes of such roads and canals as the President
of the United States might deem of national importance in a
commercial or military point of view, or necessary for the
transportation of the public mail. The surveys, plans, and
estimates for each, when completed, will be laid before
Congress.</p>
<p>In execution of this act a board of engineers was immediately
instituted, and have been since most assiduously and constantly
occupied in carrying it into effect. The first object to which
their labors were directed, by order of the late President, was
the examination of the country between the tide waters of the
Potomac, the Ohio, and Lake Erie, to ascertain the practicability
of a communication between them, to designate the most suitable
route for the same, and to form plans and estimates in detail of
the expense of execution.</p>
<p>On the 3d of February, 1825, they made their first report,
which was immediately communicated to Congress, and in which they
declared that having maturely considered the circumstances
observed by them personally, and carefully studied the results of
such of the preliminary surveys as were then completed, they were
decidedly of opinion that the communication was practicable.</p>
<p>At the last session of Congress, before the board of engineers
were enabled to make up their second report containing a general
plan and preparatory estimate for the work, the Committee of the
House of Representatives upon Roads and Canals closed the session
with a report expressing the hope that the plan and estimate of
the board of engineers might at this time be prepared, and that
the subject be referred to the early and favorable consideration
of Congress at their present session. That expected report of the
board of engineers is prepared, and will forthwith be laid before
you.</p>
<p>Under the resolution of Congress authorizing the Secretary of
War to have prepared a complete system of cavalry tactics, and a
system of exercise and instruction of field artillery, for the
use of the militia of the United States, to be reported to
Congress at the present session, a board of distinguished
officers of the Army and of the militia has been convened, whose
report will be submitted to you with that of the Secretary of
War. The occasion was thought favorable for consulting the same
board, aided by the results of a correspondence with the
governors of the several States and Territories and other
citizens of intelligence and experience, upon the acknowledged
defective condition of our militia system, and of the
improvements of which it is susceptible. The report of the board
upon this subject is also submitted for your consideration.</p>
<p>In the estimates of appropriations for the ensuing year upward
of $5,000,000 will be submitted for the expenditures to be paid
from the Department of War. Less than two-fifths of this will be
applicable to the maintenance and support of the Army. A million
and a half, in the form of pensions, goes as a scarcely adequate
tribute to the services and sacrifices of a former age, and a
more than equal sum invested in fortifications, or for the
preparations of internal improvement, provides for the quiet, the
comfort, and happier existence of the ages to come. The
appropriations to indemnify those unfortunate remnants of another
race unable alike to share in the enjoyments and to exist in the
presence of civilization, though swelling in recent years to a
magnitude burdensome to the Treasury, are generally not without
their equivalents in profitable value, or serve to discharge the
Union from engagements more burdensome than debt.</p>
<p>In like manner the estimate of appropriations for the Navy
Department will present an aggregate sum of upward of $3,000,000.
About one-half of these, however, covers the current expenditures
of the Navy in actual service, and one-half constitutes a fund of
national property, the pledge of our future glory and defense. It
was scarcely one short year after the close of the late war, and
when the burden of its expenses and charges was weighing heaviest
upon the country, that Congress, by the act of 29th April, 1816,
appropriated $1,000,000 annually for eight years to the
<i>gradual increase of the Navy</i>. At a subsequent period this
annual appropriation was reduced to half a million for six years,
of which the present year is the last. A yet more recent
appropriation the last two years, for building ten sloops of war,
has nearly restored the original appropriation of 1816 of a
million for every year. The result is before us all. We have
twelve line-of-battle ships, twenty frigates, and sloops of war
in proportion, which, with a few months of preparation, may
present a line of floating fortifications along the whole range
of our coast ready to meet any invader who might attempt to set
foot upon our shores. Combining with a system of fortifications
upon the shores themselves, commenced about the same time under
the auspices of my immediate predecessor, and hitherto
systematically pursued, it has placed in our possession the most
effective sinews of war and has left us at once an example and a
lesson from which our own duties may be inferred. The gradual
increase of the Navy was the principle of which the act of 29th
April, 1816, was the first development. It was the introduction
of a system to act upon the character and history of our country
for an indefinite series of ages. It was a declaration of that
Congress to their constituents and to posterity that it was the
destiny and the duty of these confederated States to become in
regular process of time and by no petty advances a great naval
power. That which they proposed to accomplish in eight years is
rather to be considered as the measure of their means than the
limitation of their design. They looked forward for a term of
years sufficient for the accomplishment of a definite portion of
their purpose, and they left to their successors to fill up the
canvas of which they had traced the large and prophetic outline.
The ships of the line and frigates which they had in
contemplation will be shortly completed. The time which they had
allotted for the accomplishment of the work has more than
elapsed. It remains for your consideration how their successors
may contribute their portion of toil and of treasure for the
benefit of the succeeding age in the gradual increase of our
Navy. There is perhaps no part of the exercise of the
constitutional powers of the Federal Government which has given
more general satisfaction to the people of the Union than this.
The system has not been thus vigorously introduced and hitherto
sustained to be now departed from or abandoned. In continuing to
provide for the gradual increase of the Navy it may not be
necessary or expedient to add for the present any more to the
number of our ships; but should you deem it advisable to continue
the yearly appropriation of half a million to the same objects,
it may be profitably expended in providing a supply of timber to
be seasoned and other materials for future use in the
construction of docks or in laying the foundations of a school
for naval education, as to the wisdom of Congress either of those
measures may appear to claim the preference.</p>
<p>Of the small portions of this Navy engaged in actual service
during the peace, squadrons have continued to be maintained in
the Pacific Ocean, in the West India seas, and in the
Mediterranean, to which has been added a small armament to cruise
on the eastern coast of South America. In all they have afforded
protection to our commerce, have contributed to make our country
advantageously known to foreign nations, have honorably employed
multitudes of our seamen in the service of their country, and
have inured numbers of youths of the rising generation to lives
of manly hardihood and of nautical experience and skill. The
piracies with which the West India seas were for several years
infested have been totally suppressed, but in the Mediterranean
they have increased in a manner afflictive to other nations, and
but for the continued presence of our squadron would probably
have been distressing to our own. The war which has unfortunately
broken out between the Republic of Buenos Ayres and the Brazilian
Government has given rise to very great irregularities among the
naval officers of the latter, by whom principles in relation to
blockades and to neutral navigation have been brought forward to
which we can not subscribe and which our own commanders have
found it necessary to resist. From the friendly disposition
toward the United States constantly manifested by the Emperor of
Brazil, and the very useful and friendly commercial intercourse
between the United States and his dominions, we have reason to
believe that the just reparation demanded for the injuries
sustained by several of our citizens from some of his officers
will not be withheld. Abstracts from the recent dispatches of the
commanders of our several squadrons are communicated with the
report of the Secretary of the Navy to Congress.</p>
<p>A report from the Postmaster-General is likewise communicated,
presenting in a highly satisfactory manner the result of a
vigorous, efficient, and economical administration of that
Department. The revenue of the office, even of the year including
the latter half of 1824 and the first half of 1825, had exceeded
its expenditures by a sum of more than $45,000. That of the
succeeding year has been still more productive. The increase of
the receipts in the year preceding the 1st of July last over that
of the year before exceeds $136,000, and the excess of the
receipts over the expenditures of the year has swollen from
$45,000 to nearly $80,000. During the same period contracts for
additional transportation of the mail in stages for about 260,000
miles have been made, and for 70,000 miles annually on horseback.
Seven hundred and fourteen new post-offices have been established
within the year, and the increase of revenue within the last
three years, as well as the augmentation of the transportation by
mail, is more than equal to the whole amount of receipts and of
mail conveyance at the commencement of the present century, when
the seat of the General Government was removed to this place.
When we reflect that the objects effected by the transportation
of the mail are among the choicest comforts and enjoyments of
social life, it is pleasing to observe that the dissemination of
them to every corner of our country has outstripped in their
increase even the rapid march of our population.</p>
<p>By the treaties with France and Spain, respectively ceding
Louisiana and the Floridas to the United States, provision was
made for the security of land titles derived from the Governments
of those nations. Some progress has been made under the authority
of various acts of Congress in the ascertainment and
establishment of those titles, but claims to a very large extent
remain unadjusted. The public faith no less than the just rights
of individuals and the interest of the community itself appears
to require further provision for the speedy settlement of those
claims, which I therefore recommend to the care and attention of
the Legislature.</p>
<p>In conformity with the provisions of the act of 20th May last,
to provide for erecting a penitentiary in the district of
Columbia, and for other purposes, three commissioners were
appointed to select a site for the erection of a penitentiary for
the district, and also a site in the county of Alexandria for a
county jail, both of which objects have been effected. The
building of the penitentiary has been commenced, and is in such a
degree of forwardness as to promise that it will be completed
before the meeting of the next Congress. This consideration
points to the expediency of maturing at the present session a
system for the regulation and government of the penitentiary, and
of defining the class of offenses which shall be punishable by
confinement in this edifice.</p>
<p>In closing this communication I trust that it will not be
deemed inappropriate to the occasion and purposes upon which we
are here assembled to indulge a momentary retrospect, combining
in a single glance the period of our origin as a national
confederation with that of our present existence, at the precise
interval of half a century from each other. Since your last
meeting at this place the fiftieth anniversary of the day when
our independence was declared has been celebrated throughout our
land, and on that day, while every heart was bounding with joy
and every voice was tuned to gratulation, amid the blessings of
freedom and independence which the sires of a former age had
handed down to their children, two of the principal actors in
that solemn scene-the hand that penned the ever-memorable
Declaration and the voice that sustained it in debate-were by one
summons, at the distance of 700 miles from each other, called
before the Judge of All to account for their deeds done upon
earth. They departed cheered by the benedictions of their
country, to whom they left the inheritance of their fame and the
memory of their bright example. If we turn our thoughts to the
condition of their country, in the contrast of the first and last
day of that half century, how resplendent and sublime is the
transition from gloom to glory! Then, glancing through the same
lapse of time, in the condition of the individuals we see the
first day marked with the fullness and vigor of youth, in the
pledge of their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor to
the cause of freedom and of mankind; and on the last, extended on
the bed of death, with but sense and sensibility left to breathe
a last aspiration to Heaven of blessing upon their country, may
we not humbly hope that to them too it was a pledge of transition
from gloom to glory, and that while their mortal vestments were
sinking into the clod of the valley their emancipated spirits
were ascending to the bosom of their God!</p>

<p><i>To the Senate of the United States</i>:</p>
<p>In the message to both Houses of Congress at the commencement
of their present session it was intimated that the commission for
liquidating the claims of our fellow-citizens to indemnity for
slaves and other property carried away after the close of the
late war with Great Britain in contravention to the first article
of the treaty of Ghent had been sitting in this city with
doubtful prospects of success, but that propositions had recently
passed between the two Governments which it was hoped would lead
to a satisfactory adjustment of that controversy.</p>
<p>I now transmit to the Senate, for their constitutional
consideration and advice, a convention signed at London by the
plenipotentiaries of the two Governments on the 13th of the last
month, relating to this object. A copy of the convention is at

it. To avoid all delay these documents are now transmitted,
consisting chiefly of original papers, the return of which is

fortifications erected at the expense of the State on Staten
Island, with the ordnance and other apparatus belonging to or
connected with the same. These papers were prepared at the close
of the last session of Congress, at too late a period to be then
acted upon.</p>
<p>John Quincy Adams.</p>
<p><br>
 Washington,<br>
 <i>January 16, 1827</i></p>
<p><i>To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States</i>:</p>
<p>I communicate to both Houses of Congress copies of a
convention between the United States and Great Britain, signed on
the 13th of November last at London by the respective
plenipotentiaries of the two Governments, for the final
settlement and liquidation of certain claims of indemnity of
citizens of the United States which had arisen under the first
article of the treaty of Ghent. It having been stipulated by this
convention that the exchange of the ratifications of the same
should be made at London, the usual proclamation of it here can
only be issued when that event shall have taken place, the notice
of which can scarcely be expected before the close of the present
session of Congress. But it has been duly ratified on the part of
the United States, and by the report of the Secretary of State
and the accompanying certificate herewith also communicated it
will be seen that the first half of the stipulated payment has
been made by the minister of His Britannic Majesty residing here,
and has been deposited in the office of the Bank of the United
States at this place to await the disposal of Congress.</p>
<p>I recommend to their consideration the expediency of such
legislative measures as they may deem proper for the distribution
of the sum already paid, and of that hereafter to be received,
among the claimants who may be found entitled to the
indemnity.</p>

May last, requesting a statement of expenditure and other
particulars relating to the procurement and properties of the

<p>John Quincy Adams.</p>
<p><br>
 Washington,<br>
 <i>February 5, 1827</i></p>
<p><i>To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States</i>:</p>
<p>I submit to the consideration of Congress a letter from the
agent of the United States with the Creek Indians, who invoke the
protection of the Government of the United States in defense of
the rights and territory secured to that nation by the treaty
concluded at Washington, and ratified on the part of the United
States on the 22d of April last.</p>
<p>The complaint set forth in this letter that surveyors from
Georgia have been employed in surveying lands within the Indian
Territory, as secured by that treaty, is authenticated by the
information inofficially received from other quarters, and there
is reason to believe that one or more of the surveyors have been
arrested in their progress by the Indians. Their forbearance, and
reliance upon the good faith of the United States, will, it is
hoped, avert scenes of violence and blood which there is
otherwise too much cause to apprehend will result from these
proceedings.</p>
<p>By the fifth section of the act of Congress of the 30th of
March, 1802, to regulate trade and intercourse with the Indian
tribes and to preserve peace on the frontiers, it is provided
that if any citizen of or other person resident in the United
States shall make a settlement on any lands belonging or secured
or granted by treaty with the United States to any Indian tribe,
or shall survey, or attempt to survey, such lands, or designate
any of the boundaries by marking trees or otherwise, such
offender shall forfeit a sum not exceeding $1,000 and suffer
imprisonment not exceeding twelve months.</p>
<p>By the sixteenth and seventeenth sections of the same statute
two distinct processes are prescribed, by either or both of which
the above enactment may be carried into execution. By the first
it is declared to be lawful for the military force of the United
States to apprehend every person found in the Indian country over
and beyond the boundary line between the United States and the
Indian tribes in violation of any of the provisions or
regulations of the act, and immediately to convey them, in the
hearest convenient and safe route, to the civil authority of the
United States in some of the three next adjoining States or
districts, to be proceeded against in due course of law.</p>
<p>By the second it is directed that if any person charged with
the violation of any of the provisions or regulations of the act
shall be found within any of the United States or either of their
territorial districts such offender may be there apprehended and
brought to trial in the same manner as if such crime or offense
had been committed within such State or district; and that it
shall be the duty of the military force of the United States,
when called upon by the civil magistrate or any proper officer or
other person duly authorized for that purpose and having a lawful
warrant, to aid and assist such magistrate, officer, or other
person so authorized in arresting such offender and committing
him to safe custody for trial according to law.</p>
<p>The first of these processes is adapted to the arrest of the
trespasser upon Indian territories on the spot and in the act of
committing the offense; but as it applies the action of the
Government of the United States to places where the civil process
of the law has no authorized course, it is committed entirely to
the functions of the military force to arrest the person of the
offender, and after bringing him within the reach of the
jurisdiction of the courts there to deliver him into custody for
trial. The second makes the violator of the law amenable only
after his offense has been consummated, and when he has returned
within the civil jurisdiction of the Union. This process, in the
first instance, is merely of a civil character, but may in like
manner be enforced by calling in, if necessary, the aid of the
military force.</p>
<p>Entertaining no doubt that in the present case the resort to
either of these modes of process, or to both, was within the
discretion of the Executive authority, and penetrated with the
duty of maintaining the rights of the Indians as secured both by
the treaty and the law, I concluded, after full deliberation, to
have recourse on this occasion, in the first instance, only to
the civil process. Instructions have accordingly been given by
the Secretary of War to the attorney and marshal of the United
States in the district of Georgia to commence prosecutions
against the surveyors complained of as having violated the law,
while orders have at the same time been forwarded to the agent of
the United States at once to assure the Indians that their rights
founded upon the treaty and the law are recognized by this
Government and will be faithfully protected, and earnestly to
exhort them, by the forbearance of every act of hostility on
their part, to preserve unimpaired that right to protection
secured to them by the sacred pledge of the good faith of this
nation. Copies of these instructions and orders are herewith
transmitted to Congress.</p>
<p>In abstaining at this stage of the proceedings from the
application of any military force I have been governed by
considerations which will, I trust, meet the concurrence of the
Legislature. Among them one of paramount importance has been that
these surveys have been attempted, and partly effected, under
color of legal authority from the State of Georgia; that the
surveyors are, therefore, not to be viewed in the light of
individual and solitary transgressors, but as the agents of a
sovereign State, acting in obedience to authority which they
believed to be binding upon them. Intimations had been given that
should they meet with interruption they would at all hazards be
sustained by the military force of the State, in which event, if
the military force of the Union should have been employed to
enforce its violated law, a conflict <i>must</i> have ensued,
which would itself have inflicted a wound upon the Union and have
presented the aspect of one of these confederated States at war
with the rest. Anxious, above all, to avert this state of things,
yet at the same time impressed with the deepest conviction of my
own duty to take care that the laws shall be executed and the
faith of the nation preserved, I have used of the means intrusted
to the Executive for that purpose only those which without
resorting to military force may vindicate the sanctity of the law
by the ordinary agency of the judicial tribunals.</p>
<p>It ought not, however, to be disguised that the act of the
legislature of Georgia, under the construction given to it by the
governor of that State, and the surveys made or attempted by his
authority beyond the boundary secured by the treaty of Washington
of April last to the Creek Indians, are in direct violation of
the supreme law of this land, set forth in a treaty which has
received all the sanctions provided by the Constitution which we
have been sworn to support and maintain.</p>
<p>Happily distributed as the sovereign powers of the people of
this Union have been between their General and State Governments,
their history has already too often presented collisions between
these divided authorities with regard to the extent of their
respective powers. No instance, however, has hitherto occurred in
which this collision has been urged into a conflict of actual
force. No other case is known to have happened in which the
application of military force by the Government of the Union has
been prescribed for the enforcement of a law the violation of
which has within any single State been prescribed by a
legislative act of the State. In the present instance it is my
duty to say that if the legislative and executive authorities of
the State of Georgia should persevere in acts of encroachment
upon the territories secured by a solemn treaty to the Indians,
and the laws of the Union remain unaltered, a superadded
obligation even higher than that of human authority will compel
the Executive of the United States to enforce the laws and
fulfill the duties of the nation by all the force committed for
that purpose to his charge. That the arm of military force will
be resorted to only in the event of the failure of all other
expedients provided by the laws, a pledge has been given by the
forbearance to employ it at this time. It is submitted to the
wisdom of Congress to determine whether any further act of
legislation may be necessary or expedient to meet the emergency
which these transactions may produce.</p>

but if at any time the trade and intercourse between the United
States and all or any of the above enumerated British colonial
ports authorized by the said act of Parliament should be
prohibited by a British order in council or by act of Parliament,

thereby arisen on which the President of the United States was
authorized by the sixth section aforesaid of the act of Congress
of the 1st March, 1823, to issue a proclamation to the effect
therein mentioned:</p>
<p>Now, therefore, I, John Quincy Adams, President of the United

colonial ports enumerated in the aforesaid act of Congress of the
1st of March, 1823, have been and are, upon and from the 1st day
of December, 1826, by the aforesaid two several acts of

<h2>THIRD ANNUAL MESSAGE.</h2>
<p><br>
 Washington,<br>
 <i>December 4, 1827</i></p>
<p><i>Fellow-Citizens of the Senate and of the House of
Representatives</i>:</p>
<p>A revolution of the seasons has nearly been completed since
the representatives of the people and States of this Union were
last assembled at this place to deliberate and to act upon the
common important interests of their constituents. In that
interval the never-slumbering eye of a wise and beneficent
Providence has continued its guardian care over the welfare of
our beloved country; the blessing of health has continued
generally to prevail throughout the land; the blessing of peace
with our brethren of the human race has been enjoyed without
interruption; internal quiet has left our fellow-citizens in the
full enjoyment of all their rights and in the free exercise of
all their faculties, to pursue the impulse of their nature and
the obligation of their duty in the improvement of their own
condition; the productions of the soil, the exchanges of
commerce, the vivifying labors of human industry, have combined
to mingle in our cup a portion of enjoyment as large and liberal
as the indulgence of Heaven has perhaps ever granted to the
imperfect state of man upon earth; and as the purest of human
felicity consists in its participation with others, it is no
small addition to the sum of our national happiness at this time
that peace and prosperity prevail to a degree seldom experienced
over the whole habitable globe, presenting, though as yet with
painful exceptions, a foretaste of that blessed period of promise
when the lion shall lie down with the lamb and wars shall be no
more. To preserve, to improve, and to perpetuate the sources and
to direct in their most effective channels the streams which
contribute to the public weal is the purpose for which Government
was instituted. Objects of deep importance to the welfare of the
Union are constantly recurring to demand the attention of the
Federal Legislature, and they call with accumulated interest at
the first meeting of the two Houses after their periodical
renovation. To present to their consideration from time to time
subjects in which the interests of the nation are most deeply
involved, and for the regulation of which the legislative will is
alone competent, is a duty prescribed by the Constitution, to the
performance of which the first meeting of the new Congress is a
period eminently appropriate, and which it is now my purpose to
discharge.</p>
<p>Our relations of friendship with the other nations of the
earth, political and commercial, have been preserved unimpaired,
and the opportunities to improve them have been cultivated with
anxious and unremitting attention. A negotiation upon subjects of
high and delicate interest with the Government of Great Britain
has terminated in the adjustment of some of the questions at
issue upon satisfactory terms and the postponement of others for
future discussion and agreement. The purposes of the convention
concluded at St. Petersburg on the 12th day of July, 1822, under
the mediation of the late Emperor Alexander, have been carried
into effect by a subsequent convention, concluded at London on
the 13th of November, 1826, the ratifications of which were
exchanged at that place on the 6th day of February last. A copy
of the proclamation issued on the 19th day of March last,
publishing this convention, is herewith communicated to Congress.
The sum of $1,204,960, therein stipulated to be paid to the
claimants of indemnity under the first article of the treaty of
Ghent, has been duly received, and the commission instituted,
comformably to the act of Congress of the 2d of March last, for
the distribution of the indemnity to the persons entitled to
receive it are now in session and approaching the consummation of
their labors. This final disposal of one of the most painful
topics of collision between the United States and Great Britain
not only affords an occasion of gratulation to ourselves, but has
had the happiest effect in promoting a friendly disposition and
in softening asperities upon other objects of discussion; nor
ought it to pass without the tribute of a frank and cordial
acknowledgment of the magnanimity with which an honorable nation,
by the reparation of their own wrongs, achieves a triumph more
glorious than any field of blood can ever bestow.</p>
<p>The conventions of 3d July, 1815, and of 20th October, 1818,
will expire by their own limitation on the 20th of October, 1828.
These have regulated the direct commercial intercourse between
the United States and Great Britain upon terms of the most
perfect reciprocity; and they effected a temporary compromise of
the respective rights and claims to territory westward of the
Rocky Mountains. These arrangements have been continued for an
indefinite period of time after the expiration of the
above-mentioned conventions, leaving each party the liberty of
terminating them by giving twelve months' notice to the other.
The radical principle of all commercial intercourse between
independent nations is the mutual interest of both parties. It is
the vital spirit of trade itself; nor can it be reconciled to the
nature of man or to the primary laws of human society that any
traffic should long be willingly pursued of which all the
advantages are on one side and all the burdens on the other.
Treaties of commerce have been found by experience to be among
the most effective instruments for promoting peace and harmony
between nations whose interests, exclusively considered on either
side, are brought into frequent collisions by competition. In
framing such treaties it is the duty of each party not simply to
urge with unyielding pertinacity that which suits its own
interest, but to concede liberally to that which is adapted to
the interest of the other. To accomplish this, little more is
generally required than a simple observance of the rule of
reciprocity, and were it possible for the statesmen of one nation
by stratagem and management to obtain from the weakness or
ignorance of another an overreaching treaty, such a compact would
prove an incentive to war rather than a bond of peace. Our
conventions with Great Britain are founded upon the principles of
reciprocity. The commercial intercourse between the two countries
is greater in magnitude and amount than between any two other
nations on the globe. It is for all purposes of benefit or
advantage to both as precious, and in all probability far more
extensive, than if the parties were still constituent parts of
one and the same nation. Treaties between such States, regulating
the intercourse of peace between them and adjusting interests of
such transcendent importance to both, which have been found in a
long experience of years mutually advantageous, should not be
lightly canceled or discontinued. Two conventions for continuing
in force those above mentioned have been concluded between the
plenipotentiaries of the two Governments on the 6th of August
last, and will be forthwith laid before the Senate for the
exercise of their constitutional authority concerning them.</p>
<p>In the execution of the treaties of peace of November, 1782,
and September, 1783, between the United States and Great Britain,
and which terminated the war of our independence, a line of
boundary was drawn as the demarcation of territory between the
two countries, extending over hear 20 degrees of latitude, and
ranging over seas, lakes, and mountains, then very imperfectly
explored and scarcely opened to the geographical knowledge of the
age. In the progress of discovery and settlement by both parties
since that time several questions of boundary between their
respective territories have arisen, which have been found of
exceedingly difficult adjustment. At the close of the last war
with Great Britain four of these questions pressed themselves
upon the consideration of the negotiators of the treaty of Ghent,
but without the means of concluding a definitive arrangement
concerning them. They were referred to three separate commissions
consisting of two commissioners, one appointed by each party, to
examine and decide upon their respective claims. In the event of
a disagreement between the commissioners it was provided that
they should make reports to their several Governments, and that
the reports should finally be referred to the decision of a
sovereign the common friend of both. Of these commissions two
have already terminated their sessions and investigations, one by
entire and the other by partial agreement. The commissioners of
the fifth article of the treaty of Ghent have finally disagreed,
and made their conflicting reports to their own Governments. But
from these reports a great difficulty has occurred in making up a
question to be decided by the arbitrator. This purpose has,
however, been effected by a fourth convention, concluded at
London by the plenipotentiaries of the two Governments on the
29th of September last. It will be submitted, together with the
others, to the consideration of the Senate.</p>
<p>While these questions have been pending incidents have
occurred of conflicting pretensions and of dangerous character
upon the territory itself in dispute between the two nations. By
a common understanding between the Governments it was agreed that
no exercise of exclusive jurisdiction by either party while the
negotiation was pending should change the state of the question
of right to be definitively settled. Such collision has,
nevertheless, recently taken place by occurrences the precise
character of which has not yet been ascertained. A communication
from the governor of the State of Maine, with accompanying
documents, and a correspondence between the Secretary of State
and the minister of Great Britain on this subject are now
communicated. Measures have been taken to ascertain the state of
the facts more correctly by the employment of a special agent to
visit the spot where the alleged outrages have occurred, the
result of whose inquiries, when received, will be transmitted to
Congress.</p>
<p>While so many of the subjects of high interest to the friendly
relations between the two countries have been so far adjusted, it
is matter of regret that their views respecting the commercial
intercourse between the United States and the British colonial
possessions have not equally approximated to a friendly
agreement.</p>
<p>At the commencement of the last session of Congress they were
informed of the sudden and unexpected exclusion by the British
Government of access in vessels of the United States to all their
colonial ports, except those immediately bordering upon our own
territories. In the amicable discussions which have succeeded the
adoption of this measure, which, as it affected harshly the
interests of the United States, became a subject of expostulation
on our part, the principles upon which its justification has been
placed have been of a diversified character. It has been at once
ascribed to a mere recurrence to the old, long-established
principle of colonial monopoly and at the same time to a feeling
of resentment because the offers of an act of Parliament opening
the colonial ports upon certain conditions had not been grasped
at with sufficient eagerness by an instantaneous conformity to
them. At a subsequent period it has been intimated that the new
exclusion was in resentment because a prior act of Parliament, of
1822, opening certain colonial ports, under heavy and burdensome
restrictions, to vessels of the United States, had not been
reciprocated by an admission of British vessels from the
colonies, and their cargoes, without any restriction or
discrimination whatever. But be the motive for the interdiction
what it may, the British Government have manifested no
disposition, either by negotiation or by corresponding
legislative enactments, to recede from it, and we have been given
distinctly to understand that neither of the bills which were
under the consideration of Congress at their last session would
have been deemed sufficient in their concessions to have been
rewarded by any relaxation from the British interdict. It is one
of the inconveniences inseparably connected with the attempt to
adjust by reciprocal legislation interests of this nature that
neither party can know what would be satisfactory to the other,
and that after enacting a statute for the avowed and sincere
purpose of conciliation it will generally be found utterly
inadequate to the expectations of the other party, and will
terminate in mutual disappointment.</p>
<p>The session of Congress having terminated without any act upon
the subject, a proclamation was issued on the 17th of March last,
conformably to the provisions of the sixth section of the act of
1st March, 1823, declaring the fact that the trade and
intercourse authorized by the British act of Parliament of 24th
June, 1822, between the United States and the British enumerated
colonial ports had been by the subsequent acts of Parliament of
5th July, 1825, and the order of council of 27th July, 1826,
prohibited. The effect of this proclamation, by the terms of the
act under which it was issued, has been that each and every
provision of the act concerning navigation of 18th April, 1818,
and of the act supplementary thereto of 15th May, 1820, revived
and is in full force. Such, then, is the present condition of the
trade that, useful as it is to both parties, it can, with a
single momentary exception, be carried on directly by the vessels
of neither. That exception itself is found in a proclamation of
the governor of the island of St. Christopher and of the Virgin
Islands, inviting for three months from the 28th of August last
the importation of the articles of the produce of the United
States which constitute their export portion of this trade in the
vessels of all nations. That period having already expired, the
state of mutual interdiction has again taken place. The British
Government have not only declined negotiation upon this subject,
but by the principle they have assumed with reference to it have
precluded even the means of negotiation. It becomes not the
self-respect of the United States either to solicit gratuitous
favors or to accept as the grant of a favor that for which an
ample equivalent is exacted. It remains to be determined by the
respective Governments whether the trade shall be opened by acts
of reciprocal legislation. It is, in the meantime, satisfactory
to know that apart from the inconveniences resulting from a
disturbance of the usual channels of trade no loss has been
sustained by the commerce, the navigation, or the revenue of the
United States, and none of magnitude is to be apprehended from
this existing state of mutual interdict.</p>
<p>With the other maritime and commercial nations of Europe our
intercourse continues with little variation. Since the cessation
by the convention of 24th June, 1822, of all discriminating
duties upon the vessels of the United States and of France in
either country our trade with that nation has increased and is
increasing. A disposition on the part of France has been
manifested to renew that negotiation, and in acceding to the
proposal we have expressed the wish that it might be extended to
other subjects upon which a good understanding between the
parties would be beneficial to the interests of both. The origin
of the political relations between the United States and France
is coeval with the first years of our independence. The memory of
it is interwoven with that of our arduous struggle for national
existence. Weakened as it has occasionally been since that time,
it can by us never be forgotten, and we should hail with
exultation the moment which should indicate a recollection
equally friendly in spirit on the part of France. A fresh effort
has recently been made by the minister of the United States
residing at Paris to obtain a consideration of the just claims of
citizens of the United States to the reparation of wrongs long
since committed, many of them frankly acknowledged and all of
them entitled upon every principle of justice to a candid
examination. The proposal last made to the French Government has
been to refer the subject which has formed an obstacle to this
consideration to the determination of a sovereign the common
friend of both. To this offer no definitive answer has yet been
received, but the gallant and honorable spirit which has at all
times been the pride and glory of France will not ultimately
permit the demands of innocent sufferers to be extinguished in
the mere consciousness of the power to reject them.</p>
<p>A new treaty of amity, navigation, and commerce has been
concluded with the Kingdom of Sweden, which will be submitted to
the Senate for their advice with regard to its ratification. At a
more recent date a minister plenipotentiary from the Hanseatic
Republics of Hamburg, Lubeck, and Bremen has been received,
charged with a special mission for the negotiation of a treaty of
amity and commerce between that ancient and renowned league and
the United States. This negotiation has accordingly been
commenced, and is now in progress, the result of which will, if
successful, be also submitted to the Senate for their
consideration.</p>
<p>Since the accession of the Emperor Nicholas to the imperial
throne of all the Russias the friendly dispositions toward the
United States so constantly manifested by his predecessor have
continued unabated, and have been recently testified by the
appointment of a minister plenipotentiary to reside at this
place. From the interest taken by this Sovereign in behalf of the
suffering Greeks and from the spirit with which others of the
great European powers are cooperating with him the friends of
freedom and of humanity may indulge the hope that they will
obtain relief from that most unequal of conflicts which they have
so long and so gallantly sustained; that they will enjoy the
blessing of self-government, which by their sufferings in the
cause of liberty they have richly earned, and that their
independence will be secured by those liberal institutions of
which their country furnished the earliest examples in the
history of mankind, and which have consecrated to immortal
remembrance the very soil for which they are now again profusely
pouring forth their blood. The sympathies which the people and
Government of the United States have so warmly indulged with
their cause have been acknowledged by their Government in a
letter of thanks, which I have received from their illustrious
President, a translation of which is now communicated to
Congress, the representatives of that nation to whom this tribute
of gratitude was intended to be paid, and to whom it was justly
due.</p>
<p>In the American hemisphere the cause of freedom and
independence has continued to prevail, and if signalized by none
of those splendid triumphs which had crowned with glory some of
the preceding years it has only been from the banishment of all
external force against which the struggle had been maintained.
The shout of victory has been superseded by the expulsion of the
enemy over whom it could have been achieved. Our friendly wishes
and cordial good will, which have constantly followed the
southern nations of America in all the vicissitudes of their war
of independence, are succeeded by a solicitude equally ardent and
cordial that by the wisdom and purity of their institutions they
may secure to themselves the choicest blessings of social order
and the best rewards of virtuous liberty. Disclaiming alike all
right and all intention of interfering in those concerns which it
is the prerogative of their independence to regulate as to them
shall seem fit, we hail with joy every indication of their
prosperity, of their harmony, of their persevering and inflexible
homage to those principles of freedom and of equal rights which
are alone suited to the genius and temper of the American
nations. It has been, therefore, with some concern that we have
observed indications of intestine divisions in some of the
Republics of the south, and appearances of less union with one
another than we believe to be the interest of all. Among the
results of this state of things has been that the treaties
concluded at Panama do not appear to have been ratified by the
contracting parties, and that the meeting of the congress at
Tacubaya has been indefinitely postponed. In accepting the
invitations to be represented at this congress, while a
manifestation was intended on the part of the United States of
the most friendly disposition toward the southern Republics by
whom it had been proposed, it was hoped that it would furnish an
opportunity for bringing all the nations of this hemisphere to
the common acknowledgment and adoption of the principles in the
regulation of their internal relations which would have secured a
lasting peace and harmony between them and have promoted the
cause of mutual benevolence throughout the globe. But as
obstacles appear to have arisen to the reassembling of the
congress, one of the two ministers commissioned on the part of
the United States has returned to the bosom of his country, while
the minister charged with the ordinary mission to Mexico remains
authorized to attend at the conferences of the congress whenever
they may be resumed.</p>
<p>A hope was for a short time entertained that a treaty of peace
actually signed between the Governments of Buenos Ayres and of
Brazil would supersede all further occasion for those collisions
between belligerent pretensions and neutral rights which are so
commonly the result of maritime war, and which have unfortunately
disturbed the harmony of the relations between the United States
and the Brazilian Governments. At their last session Congress
were informed that some of the naval officers of that Empire had
advanced and practiced upon principles in relation to blockades
and to neutral navigation which we could not sanction, and which
our commanders found it necessary to resist. It appears that they
have not been sustained by the Government of Brazil itself. Some
of the vessels captured under the assumed authority of these
erroneous principles have been restored, and we trust that our
just expectations will be realized that adequate indemnity will
be made to all the citizens of the United States who have
suffered by the unwarranted captures which the Brazilian
tribunals themselves have pronounced unlawful.</p>
<p>In the diplomatic discussions at Rio de Janeiro of these
wrongs sustained by citizens of the United States and of others
which seemed as if emanating immediately from that Government
itself the charg&eacute; d'affaires of the United States, under
an impression that his representations in behalf of the rights
and interests of his countrymen were totally disregarded and
useless, deemed it his duty, without waiting for instructions, to
terminate his official functions, to demand his passports, and
return to the United States. This movement, dictated by an honest
zeal for the honor and interests of his country-motives which
operated exclusively on the mind of the officer who resorted to
it-has not been disapproved by me. The Brazilian Government,
however, complained of it as a measure for which no adequate
intentional cause had been given by them, and upon an explicit
assurance through their charg&eacute; d'affaires residing here
that a successor to the late representative of the United States
hear that Government, the appointment of whom they desired,
should be received and treated with the respect due to his
character, and that indemnity should be promptly made for all
injuries inflicted on citizens of the United States or their
property contrary to the laws of nations, a temporary commission
as charge d'affaires to that country has been issued, which it is
hoped will entirety restore the ordinary diplomatic intercourse
between the two Governments and the friendly relations between
their respective nations.</p>
<p>Turning from the momentous concerns of our Union in its
intercourse with foreign nations to those of the deepest interest
in the administration of our internal affairs, we find the
revenues of the present year corresponding as nearly as might be
expected with the anticipations of the last, and presenting an
aspect still more favorable in the promise of the next. The
balance in the Treasury on January 1 last was $6,358,686.18. The
receipts from that day to the 30th of September last, as hear as
the returns of them yet received can show, amount to
$16,886,581.32. The receipts of the present quarter, estimated at
$4,515,000, added to the above form an aggregate of $21,400,000
of receipts. The expenditures of the year may perhaps amount to
$22,300,000, presenting a small excess over the receipts. But of
these twenty-two millions, upward of six have been applied to the
discharge of the principal of the public debt, the whole amount
of which, approaching seventy-four millions on the 1st of January
last, will on the first day of the next year fall short of
sixty-seven millions and a half. The balance in the Treasury on
the 1st of January next it is expected will exceed $5,450,000, a
sum exceeding that of the 1st of January, 1825, though falling
short of that exhibited on the 1st of January last.</p>
<p>It was foreseen that the revenue of the present year would not
equal that of the last, which had itself been less than that of
the next preceding year. But the hope has been realized which was
entertained, that these deficiencies would in nowise interrupt
the steady operation of the discharge of the public debt by the
annual ten millions devoted to that object by the act of 3d
March, 1817.</p>
<p>The amount of duties secured on merchandise imported from the
commencement of the year until the 30th of September last is
$21,226,000, and the probable amount of that which will be
secured during the remainder of the year is $5,774,000, forming a
sum total of $27,000,000. With the allowances for drawbacks and
contingent deficiencies which may occur, though not specifically
foreseen, we may safely estimate the receipts of the ensuing year
at $22,300,000-a revenue for the next equal to the expenditure of
the present year.</p>
<p>The deep solicitude felt by our citizens of all classes
throughout the Union for the total discharge of the public debt
will apologize for the earnestness with which I deem it my duty
to urge this topic upon the consideration of Congress-of
recommending to them again the observance of the strictest
economy in the application of the public funds. The depression
upon the receipts of the revenue which had commenced with the
year 1826 continued with increased severity during the two first
quarters of the present year. The returning tide began to flow
with the third quarter, and, so far as we can judge from
experience, may be expected to continue through the course of the
ensuing year. In the meantime an alleviation from the burden of
the public debt will in the three years have been effected to the
amount of nearly sixteen millions, and the charge of annual
interest will have been reduced upward of one million. But among
the maxims of political economy which the stewards of the public
moneys should never suffer without urgent hecessity to be
transcended is that of keeping the expenditures of the year
within the limits of its receipts. The appropriations of the two
last years, including the yearly ten millions of the sinking
fund, have each equaled the promised revenue of the ensuing year.
While we foresee with confidence that the public coffers will be
replenished from the receipts as fast as they will be drained by
the expenditures, equal in amount to those of the current year,
it should not be forgotten that they could ill suffer the
exhaustion of larger disbursements.</p>
<p>The condition of the Army and of all the branches of the
public service under the superintendence of the Secretary of War
will be seen by the report from that officer and the documents
with which it is accompanied.</p>
<p>During the last summer a detachment of the Army has been
usefully and successfully called to perform their appropriate
duties. At the moment when the commissioners appointed for
carrying into execution certain provisions of the treaty of
August 19, 1825, with various tribes of the Northwestern Indians
were about to arrive at the appointed place of meeting the
unprovoked murder of several citizens and other acts of
unequivocal hostility committed by a party of the Winnebago
tribe, one of those associated in the treaty, followed by
indications of a menacing character among other tribes of the
same region, rendered necessary an immediate display of the
defensive and protective force of the Union in that quarter. It
was accordingly exhibited by the immediate and concerted
movements of the governors of the State of Illinois and of the
Territory of Michigan, and competent levies of militia, under
their authority, with a corps of 700 men of United States troops,
under the command of General Atkinson, who, at the call of
Governor Cass, immediately repaired to the scene of danger from
their station at St. Louis. Their presence dispelled the alarms
of our fellow-citizens on those borders, and overawed the hostile
purposes of the Indians. The perpetrators of the murders were
surrendered to the authority and operation of our laws, and every
appearance of purposed hostility from those Indian tribes has
subsided.</p>
<p>Although the present organization of the Army and the
administration of its various branches of service are, upon the
whole, satisfactory, they are yet susceptible of much improvement
in particulars, some of which have been heretofore submitted to
the consideration of Congress, and others are now first presented
in the report of the Secretary of War.</p>
<p>The expediency of providing for additional numbers of officers
in the two corps of engineers will in some degree depend upon the
number and extent of the objects of national importance upon
which Congress may think it proper that surveys should be made
conformably to the act of the 30th of April, 1824. 'Of the
surveys which before the last session of Congress had been made
under the authority of that act, reports were made-</p>
<p>1. Of the Board of Internal Improvement, on the Chesapeake and
Ohio Canal.</p>
<p>2. On the continuation of the national road from Cumberland to
the tide waters within the district of Columbia.</p>
<p>3. On the continuation of the national road from Canton to
Zanesville.</p>
<p>4. On the location of the national road from Zanesville to
Columbus.</p>
<p>5. On the continuation of the same to the seat of government
in Missouri.</p>
<p>6. On a post-road from Baltimore to Philadelphia.</p>
<p>7. Of a survey of Kennebec River (in part).</p>
<p>8. On a national road from Washington to Buffalo.</p>
<p>9. On the survey of Saugatuck Harbor and River.</p>
<p>10. On a canal from Lake Pontchartrain to the Mississippi
River.</p>
<p>11. On surveys at Edgartown, Newburyport, and Hyannis
Harbor.</p>
<p>12. On survey of La Plaisance Bay, in the Territory of
Michigan.</p>
<p>And reports are now prepared and will be submitted to
Congress-</p>
<p>On surveys of the peninsula of Florida, to ascertain the
practicability of a canal to connect the waters of the Atlantic
with the Gulf of Mexico across that peninsula; and also of the
country between the bays of Mobile and of Pensacola, with the
view of connecting them together by a canal.</p>
<p>On surveys of a route for a canal to connect the waters of
James and Great Kenhawa rivers.</p>
<p>On the survey of the Swash, in Pamlico Sound, and that of Cape
Fear, below the town of Wilmington, in North Carolina.</p>
<p>On the survey of the Muscle Shoals, in the Tennessee River,
and for a route for a contemplated communication between the
Hiwassee and Coosa rivers, in the State of Alabama.</p>
<p>Other reports of surveys upon objects pointed out by the
several acts of Congress of the last and preceding sessions are
in the progress of preparation, and most of them may be completed
before the close of this session. All the officers of both corps
of engineers, with several other persons duly qualified, have
been constantly employed upon these services from the passage of
the act of 30th April, 1824, to this time. Were no other
advantage to accrue to the country from their labors than the
fund of topographical knowledge which they have collected and
communicated, that alone would have been a profit to the Union
more than adequate to all the expenditures which have been
devoted to the object; but the appropriations for the repair and
continuation of the Cumberland road, for the construction of
various other roads, for the removal of obstructions from the
rivers and harbors, for the erection of light-houses, beacons,
piers, and buoys, and for the completion of canals undertaken by
individual associations, but heeding the assistance of means and
resources more comprehensive than individual enterprise can
command, may be considered rather as treasures laid up from the
contributions of the present age for the benefit of posterity
than as unrequited applications of the accruing revenues of the
nation. To such objects of permanent improvement to the condition
of the country, of real addition to the wealth as well as to the
comfort of the people by whose authority and resources they have
been effected, from three to four millions of the annual income
of the nation have, by laws enacted at the three most recent
sessions of Congress, been applied, without intrenching upon the
necessities of the Treasury, without adding a dollar to the taxes
or debts of the community, without suspending even the steady and
regular discharge of the debts contracted in former days, which
within the same three years have been diminished by the amount of
nearly $16,000,000.</p>
<p>The same observations are in a great degree applicable to the
appropriations made for fortifications upon the coasts and
harbors of the United States, for the maintenance of the Military
Academy at West Point, and for the various objects under the
superintendence of the Department of the Navy. The report from
the Secretary of the Navy and those from the subordinate branches
of both the military departments exhibit to Congress in minute
detail the present condition of the public establishments
dependent upon them, the execution of the acts of Congress
relating to them, and the views of the officers engaged in the
several branches of the service concerning the improvements which
may tend to their perfection. The fortification of the coasts and
the gradual increase and improvement of the Navy are parts of a
great system of national defense which has been upward of ten
years in progress, and which for a series of years to come will
continue to claim the constant and persevering protection and
superintendence of the legislative authority. Among the measures
which have emanated from these principles the act of the last
session of Congress for the gradual improvement of the Navy holds
a conspicuous place. The collection of timber for the future
construction of vessels of war, the preservation and reproduction
of the species of timber peculiarly adapted to that purpose, the
construction of dry docks for the use of the Navy, the erection
of a marine railway for the repair of the public ships, and the
improvement of the navy-yards for the preservation of the public
property deposited in them have all received from the Executive
the attention required by that act, and will continue to receive
it, steadily proceeding toward the execution of all its purposes.
The establishment of a naval academy, furnishing the means of
theoretic instruction to the youths who devote their lives to the
service of their country upon the ocean, still solicits the
sanction of the Legislature. Practical seamanship and the art of
navigation may be acquired on the cruises of the squadrons which
from time to time are dispatched to distant seas, but a competent
knowledge even of the art of shipbuilding, the higher
mathematics, and astronomy; the literature which can place our
officers on a level of polished education with the officers of
other maritime nations; the knowledge of the laws, municipal and
national, which in their intercourse with foreign states and
their governments are continually called into operation, and,
above all, that acquaintance with the principles of honor and
justice, with the higher obligations of morals and of general
laws, human and divine, which constitutes the great distinction
between the warrior-patriot and the licensed robber and
pirate-these can be systematically taught and eminently acquired
only in a permanent school, stationed upon the shore and provided
with the teachers, the instruments, and the books conversant with
and adapted to the communication of the principles of these
respective sciences to the youthful and inquiring mind.</p>
<p>The report from the Postmaster-General exhibits the condition
of that Department as highly satisfactory for the present and
still more promising for the future. Its receipts for the year
ending the 1st of July last amounted to $1,473,551, and exceeded
its expenditures by upward of $100,000. It can not be an
oversanguine estimate to predict that in less than ten years, of
which one-half have elapsed, the receipts will have been more
than doubled. In the meantime a reduced expenditure upon
established routes has kept pace with increased facilities of
public accommodation and additional services have been obtained
at reduced rates of compensation. Within the last year the
transportation of the mail in stages has been greatly augmented.
The number of post-offices has been increased to 7,000, and it
may be anticipated that while the facilities of intercourse
between fellow-citizens in person or by correspondence will soon
be carried to the door of every villager in the Union, a yearly
surplus of revenue will accrue which may be applied as the wisdom
of Congress under the exercise of their constitutional powers may
devise for the further establishment and improvement of the
public roads, or by adding still further to the facilities in the
transportation of the mails. Of the indications of the prosperous
condition of our country, none can be more pleasing than those
presented by the multiplying relations of personal and intimate
intercourse between the citizens of the Union dwelling at the
remotest distances from each other.</p>
<p>Among the subjects which have heretofore occupied the earnest
solicitude and attention of Congress is the management and
disposal of that portion of the property of the nation which
consists of the public lands. The acquisition of them, made at
the expense of the whole Union, not only in treasure but in
blood, marks a right of property in them equally extensive. By
the report and statements from the General Land Office now
communicated it appears that under the present Government of the
United States a sum little short of $33,000,000 has been paid
from the common Treasury for that portion of this property which
has been purchased from France and Spain, and for the extinction
of the aboriginal titles. The amount of lands acquired is hear
260,000,000 acres, of which on the 1st of January, 1826, about
139,000,000 acres had been surveyed, and little more than
19,000,000 acres had been sold. The amount paid into the Treasury
by the purchasers of the public lands sold is not yet equal to
the sums paid for the whole, but leaves a small balance to be
refunded. The proceeds of the sales of the lands have long been
pledged to the creditors of the nation, a pledge from which we
have reason to hope that they will in a very few years be
redeemed.</p>
<p>The system upon which this great national interest has been
managed was the result of long, anxious, and persevering
deliberation. Matured and modified by the progress of our
population and the lessons of experience, it has been hitherto
eminently successful. More than nine-tenths of the lands still
remain the common property of the Union, the appropriation and
disposal of which are sacred trusts in the hands of Congress. Of
the lands sold, a considerable part were conveyed under extended
credits, which in the vicissitudes and fluctuations in the value
of lands and of their produce became oppressively burdensome to
the purchasers. It can never be the interest or the policy of the
nation to wring from its own citizens the reasonable profits of
their industry and enterprise by holding them to the rigorous
import of disastrous engagements. In March, 1821, a debt of
$22,000,000, due by purchasers of the public lands, had
accumulated, which they were unable to pay. An act of Congress of
the 2d March, 1821, came to their relief, and has been succeeded
by others, the latest being the act of the 4th of May, 1826, the
indulgent provisions of which expired on the 4th July last. The
effect of these laws has been to reduce the debt from the
purchasers to a remaining balance of about $4,300,000 due, more
than three-fifths of which are for lands within the State of
Alabama. I recommend to Congress the revival and continuance for
a further term of the beneficent accommodations to the public
debtors of that statute, and submit to their consideration, in
the same spirit of equity, the remission, under proper
discriminations, of the forfeitures of partial payments on
account of purchases of the public lands, so far as to allow of
their application to other payments.</p>
<p>There are various other subjects of deep interest to the whole
Union which have heretofore been recommended to the consideration
of Congress, as well by my predecessors as, under the impression
of the duties devolving upon me, by myself. Among these are the
debt, rather of justice than gratitude, to the surviving warriors
of the Revolutionary war; the extension of the judicial
administration of the Federal Government to those extensive and
important members of the Union which, having risen into existence
since the organization of the present judiciary establishment,
now constitute at least one-third of its territory, power, and
population; the formation of a more effective and uniform system
for the government of the militia, and the amelioration in some
form or modification of the diversified and often oppressive
codes relating to insolvency. Amidst the multiplicity of topics
of great national concernment which may recommend themselves to
the calm and patriotic deliberations of the Legislature, it may
suffice to say that on these and all other measures which may
receive their sanction my hearty cooperation will be given,
conformably to the duties enjoined upon me and under the sense of
all the obligations prescribed by the Constitution.</p>

January last, requesting the communication of information in my
possession relative to alleged aggression on the rights of
citizens of the United States by persons claiming authority under
the government of the Province of New Brunswick, I communicate a

minister of His Britannic Majesty residing here and the
government of the Province of New Brunswick have furnished the
agent of the United States with every facility for the attainment
of the information which it was the object of his mission to
procure.</p>
<p>Considering the exercise of exclusive territorial jurisdiction
upon the grounds in controversy by the government of New
Brunswick in the arrest and imprisonment of John Baker as
incompatible with the mutual understanding existing between the
Governments of the United States and of Great Britain on this
subject, a demand has been addressed to the provincial
authorities through the minister of Great Britain for the release
of that individual from prison, and of indemnity to him for his
detention'. In doing this it has not been intended to maintain
the regularity of his own proceedings or of those with whom he
was associated, to which they were not authorized by any
sovereign authority of this country.</p>
<p>The documents appended to the report of the agent being
original papers belonging to the files of the Department of
State, a return of them is requested when the Senate shall have
no further use for them.</p>

<p>The resolution of the Senate of the 28th ultimo, requesting me
to cause to be laid before the Senate all papers which might be
in the Department of War relating to the treaty concluded at the
Butte des Morts, on Fox River, between Lewis Cass and Thomas L.
McKenney, commissioners on the part of the United States, and the
Chippewa, Menomonie, and Winnebago tribes of Indians, having been
referred to the Secretary of War, the report of that officer
thereon is herewith inclosed. The papers therein referred to were
all transmitted to the Senate with the treaty. Before that event,
however, a petition and several other papers had been addressed
directly to me, in behalf of certain Indians originally and in
part still residing within the State of New York, objecting to
the ratification of the treaty, as affecting injuriously their
rights and interests. The treaty was itself withheld from the
Senate until it was understood at the War Department and by me
that by the consent of the persons representing the New York
Indians their objections were withdrawn, as by one of them, the
Reverend Eleazer Williams, I was personally assured. Those
papers, however, addressed directly to me, and which have not
been upon the files of the War Department, are now transmitted to
the Senate.</p>

<p>In conformity with the practice of all my predecessors, I have
during my service in the office of President transmitted to the
two Houses of Congress from time to time, by the same private
secretary, such messages as a proper discharge of my
constitutional duty appeared to me to require. On Tuesday last he
was charged with the delivery of a message to each House. Having
presented that which was intended for the House of
Representatives, whilst he was passing, within the Capitol, from
their Hall to the Chamber of the Senate, for the purpose of
delivering the other message, he was waylaid and assaulted in the
Rotunda by a person, in the presence of a member of the House,
who interposed and separated the parties.</p>
<p>I have thought it my duty to communicate this occurrence to
Congress, to whose wisdom it belongs to consider whether it is of
a nature requiring from them any animadversion, and also whether
any further laws or regulations are necessary to insure security
in the official intercourse between the President and Congress,
and to prevent disorders within the Capitol itself.</p>
<p>In the deliberations of Congress upon this subject it is
neither expected nor desired that any consequence shall be
attached to the private relation in which my secretary stands to
me.</p>

customs at Key West took possession of these persons, who were
afterwards delivered over to the marshal of the Territory of East
Florida, by whom they were conveyed to St. Augustine, where they
still remain.</p>
<p>Believing that the circumstances under which they have been
cast upon the compassion of the country are not embraced by the
provisions of the act of Congress of 3d March, 1819, or of the

<h2>PROCLAMATION.</h2>

<p>A PROCLAMATION.</p>
<br>

<p>Whereas by an act of the Congress of the United States of the
7th of January, 1824, entitled "An act concerning discriminating
duties of tonnage and impost," it is provided that upon
satisfactory evidence being given to the President of the United
States by the government of any foreign nation that no
discriminating duties of tonnage or impost are imposed or levied
within the ports of the said nation upon vessels belonging wholly
to citizens of the United States or upon merchandise the produce
or manufacture thereof imported in the same, the President is
thereby authorized to issue his proclamation declaring that the
foreign discriminating duties of tonnage and impost within the
United States are and shall be suspended and discontinued so far
as respects the vessels of the said nation and the merchandise of
its produce or manufacture imported into the United States in the
same, the said suspension to take effect from the time of such
notification being given to the President of the United States,
and to continue so long as the reciprocal exemption of vessels
belonging to citizens of the United States and merchandise as
aforesaid thereon laden shall be continued, and no longer;
and</p>
<p>Whereas satisfactory evidence has been received by me from His
Britannic Majesty, as King of Hanover, through the Right
Honorable Charles Richard Vaughan, his envoy extraordinary and
minister plenipotentiary, that vessels wholly belonging to
citizens of the United States or merchandise the produce or
manufacture thereof imported in such vessels are not nor shall be
on their entering any Hanoverian port subject to the payment of
higher duties of tonnage or impost than are levied on Hanoverian
ships or merchandise the produce or manufacture of the United
States imported in such vessels:</p>
<p>Now, therefore, I, John Quincy Adams, President of the United
States of America, do hereby declare and proclaim that so much of
the several acts imposing duties on the tonnage of ships and
vessels and on goods, wares, and merchandise imported into the
United States as imposed a discriminating duty of tonnage between
the vessels of the Kingdom of Hanover and vessels of the United
States and between goods imported into the United States in
vessels of the Kingdom of Hanover and vessels of the United
States are suspended and discontinued so far as the same respect
the produce or manufacture of the said Kingdom of Hanover, the
said suspension to take effect this day and to continue
henceforward so long as the reciprocal exemption of the vessels
of the United States and of the merchandise laden therein as
aforesaid shall be continued in the ports of the Kingdom of
Hanover.</p>

<h2>EXECUTIVE ORDER.</h2>
<p><br>
 Department of War,<br>
 <i>February 28, 1828</i>.</p>
<p>The Secretary of War, by direction of the President of the
United States, announces to the Army the painful intelligence of
the decease (the 24th of February) of Major-General Brown.</p>
<p>To say that he was one of the men who have rendered most
important services to his country would fall far short of the
tribute due to his character. Uniting with the most unaffected
simplicity the highest degree of personal valor and of
intellectual energy, he stands preeminent before the world and
for after ages in that band of heroic spirits who upon the ocean
and the land formed and sustained during the second war with
Great Britain the martial reputation of their country. To this
high and honorable purpose General Brown may be truly said to
have sacrificed his life, for the disease which abridged his days
and has terminated his career at a period scarcely beyond the
meridian of manhood undoubtedly originated in the hardships of
his campaigns on the Canada frontier, and in that glorious wound
which, though desperate, could not remove him from the field of
battle till it was won.</p>
<p>Quick to perceive, sagacious to anticipate, prompt to decide,
and daring in execution, he was born with the qualities which
constitute a great commander. His military <i>coup d'oeil</i>.
his intuitive penetration, his knowledge of men and his capacity
to control them were known to all his companions in arms, and
commanded their respect; while the gentleness of his disposition,
the courtesy of his deportment, his scrupulous regard to their
rights, his constant attention to their wants, and his
affectionate attachment to their persons universally won their
hearts and bound them to him as a father.</p>
<p>Calm and collected in the presence of the enemy, he was withal
tender of human life; in the hour of battle more sparing of the
blood of the soldier than his own. In the hour of victory the
vanquished enemy found in him a humane and compassionate friend.
Not one drop of blood shed in wantonness or cruelty sullies the
purity of his fame. Defeat he was never called to endure, but in
the crisis of difficulty and danger he displayed untiring
patience and fortitude not to be overcome.</p>
<p>Such was the great and accomplished captain whose loss the
Army has now, in common with their fellow-citizens of all
classes, to deplore. While indulging the kindly impulses of
nature and yielding the tribute of a tear upon his grave, let it
not be permitted to close upon his bright example as it must upon
his mortal remains. Let him be more nobly sepulchered in the
hearts of his fellow-soldiers, and his imperishable monument be
found in their endeavors to emulate his virtues.</p>
<p>The officers of the Army will wear the badge of mourning for
six months on the left arm and hilt of the sword. Guns will be
fired at each military post at intervals of thirty minutes from
the rising to the setting of the sun on the day succeeding the
arrival of this order, during which the National flag will be
suspended at half-mast.</p>

<h2>FOURTH ANNUAL MESSAGE.</h2>
<p><br>
 Washington,<br>
 <i>December 2, 1828</i>.</p>
<p><i>Fellow-Citizens of the Senate and of the House of
Representatives</i>:</p>
<p>If the enjoyment in profusion of the bounties of Providence
forms a suitable subject of mutual gratulation and grateful
acknowledgment, we are admonished at this return of the season
when the representatives of the nation are assembled to
deliberate upon their concerns to offer up the tribute of fervent
and grateful hearts for the never-failing mercies of Him who
ruleth over all. He has again favored us with healthful seasons
and abundant harvests; He has sustained us in peace with foreign
countries and in tranquillity within our borders; He has
preserved us in the quiet and undisturbed possession of civil and
religious liberty; He has crowned the year with His goodness,
imposing on us no other conditions than of improving for our own
happiness the blessings bestowed by His hands, and, in the
fruition of all His favors, of devoting the faculties with which
we have been endowed by Him to His glory and to our own temporal
and eternal welfare.</p>
<p>In the relations of our Federal Union with our brethren of the
human race the changes which have occurred since the close of
your last session have generally tended to the preservation of
peace and to the cultivation of harmony. Before your last
separation a war had unhappily been kindled between the Empire of
Russia, one of those with which our intercourse has been no other
than a constant exchange of good offices, and that of the Ottoman
Porte, a nation from which geographical distance, religious
opinions and maxims of government on their part little suited to
the formation of those bonds of mutual benevolence which result
from the benefits of commerce had kept us in a state, perhaps too
much prolonged, of coldness and alienation. The extensive,
fertile, and populous dominions of the Sultan belong rather to
the Asiatic than the European division of the human family. They
enter but partially into the system of Europe, nor have their
wars with Russia and Austria, the European States upon which they
border, for more than a century past disturbed the pacific
relations of those States with the other great powers of Europe.
Neither France nor Prussia nor Great Britain has ever taken part
in them, nor is it to be expected that they will at this time.
The declaration of war by Russia has received the approbation or
acquiescence of her allies, and we may indulge the hope that its
progress and termination will be signalized by the moderation and
forbearance no less than by the energy of the Emperor Nicholas,
and that it will afford the opportunity for such collateral
agency in behalf of the suffering Greeks as will secure to them
ultimately the triumph of humanity and of freedom.</p>
<p>The state of our particular relations with France has scarcely
varied in the course of the present year. The commercial
intercourse between the two countries has continued to increase
for the mutual benefit of both. The claims of indemnity to
numbers of our fellow-citizens for depredations upon their
property, heretofore committed during the revolutionary
governments, remain unadjusted, and still form the subject of
earnest representation and remonstrance. Recent advices from the
minister of the United States at Paris encourage the expectation
that the appeal to the justice of the French Government will ere
long receive a favorable consideration.</p>
<p>The last friendly expedient has been resorted to for the
decision of the controversy with Great Britain relating to the
northeastern boundary of the United States. By an agreement with
the British Government, carrying into effect the provisions of
the fifth article of the treaty of Ghent, and the convention of
29th September, 1827, His Majesty the King of the Netherlands has
by common consent been selected as the umpire between the
parties. The proposal to him to accept the designation for the
performance of this friendly office will be made at an early day,
and the United States, relying upon the justice of their cause,
will cheerfully commit the arbitrament of it to a prince equally
distinguished for the independence of his spirit, his
indefatigable assiduity to the duties of his station, and his
inflexible personal probity.</p>
<p>Our commercial relations with Great Britain will deserve the
serious consideration of Congress and the exercise of a
conciliatory and forbearing spirit in the policy of both
Governments. The state of them has been materially changed by the
act of Congress, passed at their last session, in alteration of
the several acts imposing duties on imports, and by acts of more
recent date of the British Parliament. The effect of the
interdiction of direct trade, commenced by Great Britain and
reciprocated by the United States, has been, as was to be
foreseen, only to substitute different channels for an exchange
of commodities indispensable to the colonies and profitable to a
numerous class of our fellow-citizens. The exports, the revenue,
the navigation of the United States have suffered no diminution
by our exclusion from direct access to the British colonies. The
colonies pay more dearly for the necessaries of life which their
Government burdens with the charges of double voyages, freight,
insurance, and commission, and the profits of our exports are
somewhat impaired and more injuriously transferred from one
portion of our citizens to another. The resumption of this old
and otherwise exploded system of colonial exclusion has not
secured to the shipping interest of Great Britain the relief
which, at the expense of the distant colonies and of the United
States, it was expected to afford. Other measures have been
resorted to more pointedly bearing upon the navigation of the
United States, and which, unless modified by the construction
given to the recent acts of Parliament, will be manifestly
incompatible with the positive stipulations of the commercial
convention existing between the two countries. That convention,
however, may be terminated with twelve months' notice, at the
option of either party.</p>
<p>A treaty of amity, navigation, and commerce between the United
States and His Majesty the Emperor of Austria, King of Hungary
and Bohemia, has been prepared for signature by the Secretary of
State and by the Baron de Lederer, intrusted with full powers of
the Austrian Government. Independently of the new and friendly
relations which may be thus commenced with one of the most
eminent and powerful nations of the earth, the occasion has been
taken in it, as in other recent treaties concluded by the United
States, to extend those principles of liberal intercourse and of
fair reciprocity which intertwine with the exchanges of commerce
the principles of justice and the feelings of mutual benevolence.
This system, first proclaimed to the world in the first
commercial treaty ever concluded by the United States-that of 6th
February, 1778, with France-has been invariably the cherished
policy of our Union. It is by treaties of commerce alone that it
can be made ultimately to prevail as the established system of
all civilized nations. With this principle our fathers extended
the hand of friendship to every nation of the globe, and to this
policy our country has ever since adhered. Whatever of regulation
in our laws has ever been adopted unfavorable to the interest of
any foreign nation has been essentially defensive and
counteracting to similar regulations of theirs operating against
us.</p>
<p>Immediately after the close of the War of Independence
commissioners were appointed by the Congress of the Confederation
authorized to conclude treaties with every nation of Europe
disposed to adopt them. Before the wars of the French Revolution
such treaties had been consummated with the United Netherlands,
Sweden, and Prussia. During those wars treaties with Great
Britain and Spain had been effected, and those with Prussia and
France renewed. In all these some concessions to the liberal
principles of intercourse proposed by the United States had been
obtained; but as in all the negotiations they came occasionally
in collision with previous internal regulations or exclusive and
excluding compacts of monopoly with which the other parties had
been trammeled, the advances made in them toward the freedom of
trade were partial and imperfect. Colonial establishments,
chartered companies, and shipbuilding influence pervaded and
encumbered the legislation of all the great commercial states;
and the United States, in offering free trade and equal privilege
to all, were compelled to acquiesce in many exceptions with each
of the parties to their treaties, accommodated to their existing
laws and anterior engagements.</p>
<p>The colonial system by which this whole hemisphere was bound
has fallen into ruins, totally abolished by revolutions
converting colonies into independent nations throughout the two
American continents, excepting a portion of territory chiefly at
the northern extremity of our own, and confined to the remnants
of dominion retained by Great Britain over the insular
archipelago, geographically the appendages of our part of the
globe. With all the rest we have free trade, even with the
insular colonies of all the European nations, except Great
Britain. Her Government also had manifested approaches to the
adoption of a free and liberal intercourse between her colonies
and other nations, though by a sudden and scarcely explained
revulsion the spirit of exclusion has been revived for operation
upon the United States alone.</p>
<p>The conclusion of our last treaty of peace with Great Britain
was shortly afterwards followed by a commercial convention,
placing the direct intercourse between the two countries upon a
footing of more equal reciprocity than had ever before been
admitted. The same principle has since been much further extended
by treaties with France, Sweden, Denmark, the Hanseatic cities,
Prussia, in Europe, and with the Republics of Colombia and of
Central America, in this hemisphere. The mutual abolition of
discriminating duties and charges upon the navigation and
commercial intercourse between the parties is the general maxim
which characterizes them all. There is reason to expect that it
will at no distant period be adopted by other nations, both of
Europe and America, and to hope that by its universal prevalence
one of the fruitful sources of wars of commercial competition
will be extinguished.</p>
<p>Among the nations upon whose Governments many of our
fellow-citizens have had long-pending claims of indemnity for
depredations upon their property during a period when the rights
of neutral commerce were disregarded was that of Denmark. They
were soon after the events occurred the subject of a special
mission from the United States, at the close of which the
assurance was given by His Danish Majesty that at a period of
more tranquillity and of less distress they would be considered,
examined, and decided upon in a spirit of determined purpose for
the dispensation of justice. I have much pleasure in informing
Congress that the fulfillment of this honorable promise is now in
progress; that a small portion of the claims has already been
settled to the satisfaction of the claimants, and that we have
reason to hope that the remainder will shortly be placed in a
train of equitable adjustment. This result has always been
confidently expected, from the character of personal integrity
and of benevolence which the Sovereign of the Danish dominions
has through every vicissitude of fortune maintained.</p>
<p>The general aspect of the affairs of our highborn American
nations of the south has been rather of approaching than of
settled tranquillity. Internal disturbances have been more
frequent among them than their common friends would have desired.
Our intercourse with all has continued to be that of friendship
and of mutual good will. Treaties of commerce and of boundaries
with the United Mexican States have been negotiated, but, from
various successive obstacles, not yet brought to a final
conclusion.</p>
<p>The civil war which unfortunately still prevails in the
Republics of Central America has been unpropitious to the
cultivation of our commercial relations with them; and the
dissensions and revolutionary changes in the Republics of
Colombia and of Peru have been seen with cordial regret by us,
who would gladly contribute to the happiness of both. It is with
great satisfaction, however, that we have witnessed the recent
conclusion of a peace between the Governments of Buenos Ayres and
of Brazil, and it is equally gratifying to observe that indemnity
has been obtained for some of the injuries which our
fellow-citizens had sustained in the latter of those countries.
The rest are in a train of negotiation, which we hope may
terminate to mutual satisfaction, and that it may be succeeded by
a treaty of commerce and navigation, upon liberal principles,
propitious to a great and growing commerce, already important to
the interests of our country.</p>
<p>The condition and prospects of the revenue are more favorable
than our most sanguine expectations had anticipated. The balance
in the Treasury on the 1st of January last, exclusive of the
moneys received under the convention of 13th of November, 1826,
with Great Britain, was $5,861,972.83. The receipts into the
Treasury from the 1st of January to the 30th of September last,
so far as they have been ascertained to form the basis of an
estimate, amount to $18,633,580.27, which, with the receipts of
the present quarter, estimated at $5,461,283.40, form an
aggregate of receipts during the year of $24,094,863.67. The
expenditures of the year may probably amount to $25,637,111.63,
and leave in the Treasury on the 1st of January next the sum of
$5,125,638.14.</p>
<p>The receipts of the present year have amounted to hear two
millions more than was anticipated at the commencement of the
last session of Congress.</p>
<p>The amount of duties secured on importations from the 1st of
January to the 30th of September was about $22,997,000, and that
of the estimated accruing revenue is five millions, forming an
aggregate for the year of hear twenty-eight millions. This is one
million more than the estimate made last December for the
accruing revenue of the present year, which, with allowances for
drawbacks and contingent deficiencies, was expected to produce an
actual revenue of $22,300,000. Had these only been realized the
expenditures of the year would have been also proportionally
reduced, for of these twenty-four millions received upward of
nine millions have been applied to the extinction of public debt,
bearing an interest of 6 per cent a year, and of course reducing
the burden of interest annually payable in future by the amount
of more than half a million. The payments on account of interest
during the current year exceed $3,000,000, presenting an
aggregate of more than twelve millions applied during the year to
the discharge of the public debt, the whole of which remaining
due on the 1st of January next will amount only to
$58,362,135.78.</p>
<p>That the revenue of the ensuing year will not fall short of
that received in the one now expiring there are indications which
can scarcely prove deceptive. In our country an uniform
experience of forty years has shown that whatever the tariff of
duties upon articles imported from abroad has been, the amount of
importations has always borne an average value nearly approaching
to that of the exports, though occasionally differing in the
balance, sometimes being more and sometimes less. It is, indeed,
a general law of prosperous commerce that the real value of
exports should by a small, and only a small, balance exceed that
of imports, that balance being a permanent addition to the wealth
of the nation. The extent of the prosperous commerce of the
nation must be regulated by the amount of its exports, and an
important addition to the value of these will draw after it a
corresponding increase of importations. It has happened in the
vicissitudes of the seasons that the harvests of all Europe have
in the late summer and autumn fallen short of their usual
average. A relaxation of the interdict upon the importation of
grain and flour from abroad has ensued, a propitious market has
been opened to the granaries of our country, and a new prospect
of reward presented to the labors of the husbandman, which for
several years has been denied. This accession to the profits of
agriculture in the middle and western portions of our Union is
accidental and temporary. It may continue only for a single year.
It may be, as has been often experienced in the revolutions of
time, but the first of several scanty harvests in succession. We
may consider it certain that for the approaching year it has
added an item of large amount to the value of our exports and
that it will produce a corresponding increase of importations. It
may therefore confidently be foreseen that the revenue of 1829
will equal and probably exceed that of 1828, and will afford the
means of extinguishing ten millions more of the principal of the
public debt.</p>
<p>This new element of prosperity to that part of our
agricultural industry which is occupied in producing the first
article of human subsistence is of the most cheering character to
the feelings of patriotism. Proceeding from a cause which
humanity will view with concern, the sufferings of scarcity in
distant lands, it yields a consolatory reflection that this
scarcity is in no respect attributable to us; that it comes from
the dispensation of Him who ordains all in wisdom and goodness,
and who permits evil itself only as an instrument of good; that,
far from contributing to this scarcity, our agency will be
applied only to the alleviation of its severity, and that in
pouring forth from the abundance of our own garners the supplies
which will partially restore plenty to those who are in heed we
shall ourselves reduce our stores and add to the price of our own
bread, so as in some degree to participate in the wants which it
will be the good fortune of our country to relieve.</p>
<p>The great interests of an agricultural, commercial, and
manufacturing nation are so linked in union together that no
permanent cause of prosperity to one of them can operate without
extending its influence to the others. All these interests are
alike under the protecting power of the legislative authority,
and the duties of the representative bodies are to conciliate
them in harmony together. So far as the object of taxation is to
raise a revenue for discharging the debts and defraying the
expenses of the community, its operation should be adapted as
much as possible to suit the burden with equal hand upon all in
proportion with their ability of bearing it without oppression.
But the legislation of one nation is sometimes intentionally made
to bear heavily upon the interests of another. That legislation,
adapted, as it is meant to be, to the special interests of its
own people, will often press most unequally upon the several
component interests of its neighbors. Thus the legislation of
Great Britain, when, as has recently been avowed, adapted to the
depression of a rival nation, will naturally abound with
regulations of interdict upon the productions of the soil or
industry of the other which come in competition with its own, and
will present encouragement, perhaps even bounty, to the raw
material of the other State which it can not produce itself, and
which is essential for the use of its manufactures, competitors
in the markets of the world with those of its commercial rival.
Such is the state of the commercial legislation of Great Britain
as it bears upon our interests. It excludes with interdicting
duties all importation (except in time of approaching famine) of
the great staple of productions of our Middle and Western States;
it proscribes with equal rigor the bulkier lumber and live stock
of the same portion and also of the Northern and Eastern part of
our Union. It refuses even the rice of the South unless
aggravated with a charge of duty upon the Northern carrier who
brings it to them. But the cotton, indispensable for their looms,
they will receive almost duty free to weave it into a fabric for
our own wear, to the destruction of our own manufactures, which
they are enabled thus to undersell.</p>
<p>Is the self-protecting energy of this nation so helpless that
there exists in the political institutions of our country no
power to counteract the bias of this foreign legislation; that
the growers of grain must submit to this exclusion from the
foreign markets of their produce; that the shippers must
dismantle their ships, the trade of the North stagnate at the
wharves, and the manufacturers starve at their looms, while the
whole people shall pay tribute to foreign industry to be clad in
a foreign garb; that the Congress of the Union are impotent to
restore the balance in favor of native industry destroyed by the
statutes of another realm? More just and more generous sentiments
will, I trust, prevail. If the tariff adopted at the last session
of Congress shall be found by experience to bear oppressively
upon the interests of any one section of the Union, it ought to
be, and I can not doubt will be, so modified as to alleviate its
burden. To the voice of just complaint from any portion of their
constituents the representatives of the States and of the people
will never turn away their ears. But so long as the duty of the
foreign shall operate only as a bounty upon the domestic article;
while the planter and the merchant and the shepherd and the
husbandman shall be found thriving in their occupations under the
duties imposed for the protection of domestic manufactures, they
will not repine at the prosperity shared with themselves by their
fellow-citizens of other professions, nor denounce as violations
of the Constitution the deliberate acts of Congress to shield
from the wrongs of foreign laws the native industry of the Union.
While the tariff of the last session of Congress was a subject of
legislative deliberation it was foretold by some of its opposers
that one of its necessary consequences would be to impair the
revenue. It is yet too soon to pronounce with confidence that
this prediction was erroneous. The obstruction of one avenue of
trade not unfrequently opens an issue to another. The consequence
of the tariff will be to increase the exportation and to diminish
the importation of some specific articles; but by the general law
of trade the increase of exportation of one article will be
followed by an increased importation of others, the duties upon
which will supply the deficiencies which the diminished
importation would otherwise occasion. The effect of taxation upon
revenue can seldom be foreseen with certainty. It must abide the
test of experience. As yet no symptom? of diminution are
perceptible in the receipts of the Treasury. As yet little
addition of cost has even been experienced upon the articles
burdened with heavier duties by the last tariff. The domestic
manufacturer supplies the same or a kindred article at a
diminished price, and the consumer pays the same tribute to the
labor of his own countryman which he must otherwise have paid to
foreign industry and toil.</p>
<p>The tariff of the last session was in its details not
acceptable to the great interests of any portion of the Union,
not even to the interest which it was specially intended to
subserve. Its object was to balance the burdens upon native
industry imposed by the operation of foreign laws, but not to
aggravate the burdens of one section of the Union by the relief
afforded to another. To the great principle sanctioned by that
act-one of those upon which the Constitution itself was formed-I
hope and trust the authorities of the Union will adhere. But if
any of the duties imposed by the act only relieve the
manufacturer by aggravating the burden of the planter, let a
careful revisal of its provisions, enlightened by the practical
experience of its effects, be directed to retain those which
impart protection to native industry and remove or supply the
place of those which only alleviate one great national interest
by the depression of another.</p>
<p>The United States of America and the people of every State of
which they are composed are each of them sovereign powers. The
legislative authority of the whole is exercised by Congress under
authority granted them in the common Constitution. The
legislative power of each State is exercised by assemblies
deriving their authority from the constitution of the State. Each
is sovereign within its own province. The distribution of power
between them presupposes that these authorities will move in
harmony with each other. The members of the State and General
Governments are all under oath to support both, and allegiance is
due to the one and to the other. The case of a conflict between
these two powers has not been supposed, nor has any provision
been made for it in our institutions; as a virtuous nation of
ancient times existed more than five centuries without a law for
the punishment of parricide.</p>
<p>More than once, however, in the progress of our history have
the people and the legislatures of one or more States, in moments
of excitement, been instigated to this conflict; and the means of
effecting this impulse have been allegations that the acts of
Congress to be resisted were <i>unconstitutional</i>. The people
of no one State have ever delegated to their legislature the
power of pronouncing an act of Congress unconstitutional, but
they have delegated to them powers by the exercise of which the
execution of the laws of Congress within the State may be
resisted. If we suppose the case of such conflicting legislation
sustained by the corresponding executive and judicial
authorities, patriotism and philanthropy turn their eyes from the
condition in which the parties would be placed, and from that of
the people of both, which must be its victims.</p>
<p>The reports from the Secretary of War and the various
subordinate offices of the resort of that Department present an
exposition of the public administration of affairs connected with
them through the course of the current year. The present state of
the Army and the distribution of the force of which it is
composed will be seen from the report of the Major-General.
Several alterations in the disposal of the troops have been found
expedient in the course of the year, and the discipline of the
Army, though not entirely free from exception, has been generally
good.</p>
<p>The attention of Congress is particularly invited to that part
of the report of the Secretary of War which concerns the existing
system of our relations with the Indian tribes. At the
establishment of the Federal Government under the present
Constitution of the United States the principle was adopted of
considering them as foreign and independent powers and also as
proprietors of lands. They were, moreover, considered as savages,
whom it was our policy and our duty to use our influence in
converting to Christianity and in bringing within the pale of
civilization.</p>
<p>As independent powers, we negotiated with them by treaties; as
proprietors, we purchased of them all the lands which we could
prevail upon them to sell; as brethren of the human race, rude
and ignorant, we endeavored to bring them to the knowledge of
religion and of letters. The ultimate design was to incorporate
in our own institutions that portion of them which could be
converted to the state of civilization. In the practice of
European States, before our Revolution, they had been considered
<i>as children</i> to be governed; as tenants at discretion, to
be dispossessed as occasion might require; as hunters to be
indemnified by trifling concessions for removal from the grounds
from which their game was extirpated. In changing the system it
would seem as if a full contemplation of the consequences of the
change had not been taken. We have been far more successful in
the acquisition of their lands than in imparting to them the
principles or inspiring them with the spirit of civilization. But
in appropriating to ourselves their hunting grounds we have
brought upon ourselves the obligation of providing them with
subsistence; and when we have had the rare good fortune of
teaching them the arts of civilization and the doctrines of
Christianity we have unexpectedly found them forming in the midst
of ourselves communities claiming to be independent of ours and
rivals of sovereignty within the territories of the members of
our Union. This state of things requires that a remedy should be
provided-a remedy which, while it shall do justice to those
unfortunate children of nature, may secure to the members of our
confederation their rights of sovereignty and of soil. As the
outline of a project to that effect, the views presented in the
report of the Secretary of War are recommended to the
consideration of Congress.</p>
<p>The report from the Engineer Department presents a
comprehensive view of the progress which has been made in the
great systems promotive of the public interest, commenced and
organized under authority of Congress, and the effects of which
have already contributed to the security, as they will hereafter
largely contribute to the honor and dignity, of the nation.</p>
<p>The first of these great systems is that of fortifications,
commenced immediately after the close of our last war, under the
salutary experience which the events of that war had impressed
upon our countrymen of its hecessity. Introduced under the
auspices of my immediate predecessor, it has been continued with
the persevering and liberal encouragement of the Legislature,
and, combined with corresponding exertions for the gradual
increase and improvement of the Navy, prepares for our extensive
country a condition of defense adapted to any critical emergency
which the varying course of events may bring forth. Our advances
in these concerted systems have for the last ten years been
steady and progressive, and in a few years more will be so
completed as to leave no cause for apprehension that our seacoast
will ever again offer a theater of hostile invasion.</p>
<p>The next of these cardinal measures of policy is the
preliminary to great and lasting works of public improvement in
the surveys of roads, examination for the course of canals, and
labors for the removal of the obstructions of rivers and harbors,
first commenced by the act of Congress of 30th of April,
1824.</p>
<p>The report exhibits in one table the funds appropriated at the
last and preceding sessions of Congress for all these
fortifications, surveys, and works of public improvement, the
manner in which these funds have been applied, the amount
expended upon the several works under construction, and the
further sums which may be necessary to complete them; in a
second, the works projected by the Board of Engineers which have
not been commenced, and the estimate of their cost; in a third,
the report of the annual Board of Visitors at the Military
Academy at West Point.</p>
<p>For thirteen fortifications erecting on various points of our
Atlantic coast, from Rhode Island to Louisiana, the aggregate
expenditure of the year has fallen little short of $1,000,000.
For the preparation of five additional reports of reconnaissances
and surveys since the last session of Congress, for the civil
constructions upon thirty-seven different public works commenced,
eight others for which specific appropriations have been made by
acts of Congress, and twenty other incipient surveys under the
authority given by the act of 30th April, 1824, about one million
more of dollars has been drawn from the Treasury.</p>
<p>To these $2,000,000 is to be added the appropriation of
$250,000 to commence the erection of a breakwater hear the mouth
of the Delaware River, the subscriptions to the Delaware and
Chesapeake, the Louisville and Portland, the Dismal Swamp, and
the Chesapeake and Ohio canals, the large donations of lands to
the States of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, and Alabama for objects of
improvements within those States, and the sums appropriated for
light-houses, buoys, and piers on the coast; and a full view will
be taken of the munificence of the nation in the application of
its resources to the improvement of its own condition.</p>
<p>Of these great national undertakings the Academy at West Point
is among the most important in itself and the most comprehensive
in its consequences. In that institution a part of the revenue of
the nation is applied to defray the expense of educating a
competent portion of her youth chiefly to the knowledge and the
duties of military life. It is the living armory of the nation.
While the other works of improvement enumerated in the reports
now presented to the attention of Congress are destined to
ameliorate the face of nature, to multiply the facilities of
communication between the different parts of the Union, to assist
the labors, increase the comforts, and enhance the enjoyments of
individuals, the instruction acquired at West Point enlarges the
dominion and expands the capacities of the mind. Its beneficial
results are already experienced in the composition of the Army,
and their influence is felt in the intellectual progress of
society. The institution is susceptible still of great
improvement from benefactions proposed by several successive
Boards of Visitors, to whose earnest and repeated recommendations
I cheerfully add my own.</p>
<p>With the usual annual reports from the Secretary of the Navy
and the Board of Commissioners will be exhibited to the view of
Congress the execution of the laws relating to that department of
the public service. The repression of piracy in the West Indian
and in the Grecian seas has been effectually maintained, with
scarcely any exception. During the war between the Governments of
Buenos Ayres and of Brazil frequent collisions between the
belligerent acts of power and the rights of neutral commerce
occurred. Licentious blockades, irregularly enlisted or impressed
seamen, and the property of honest commerce seized with violence,
and even plundered under legal pretenses, are disorders never
separable from the conflicts of war upon the ocean. With a
portion of them the correspondence of our commanders on the
eastern aspect of the South American coast and among the islands
of Greece discover how far we have been involved. In these the
honor of our country and the rights of our citizens have been
asserted and vindicated. The appearance of new squadrons in the
Mediterranean and the blockade of the Dardanelles indicate the
danger of other obstacles to the freedom of commerce and the
hecessity of keeping our naval force in those seas. To the
suggestions repeated in the report of the Secretary of the Navy,
and tending to the permanent improvement of this institution, I
invite the favorable consideration of Congress.</p>
<p>A resolution of the House of Representatives requesting that
one of our small public vessels should be sent to the Pacific
Ocean and South Sea to examine the coasts, islands, harbors,
shoals, and reefs in those seas, and to ascertain their true
situation and description, has been put in a train of execution.
The vessel is nearly ready to depart. The successful
accomplishment of the expedition may be greatly facilitated by
suitable legislative provisions, and particularly by an
appropriation to defray its necessary expense. The addition of a
second, and perhaps a third, vessel, with a slight aggravation of
the cost, would contribute much to the safety of the citizens
embarked on this undertaking, the results of which may be of the
deepest interest to our country.</p>
<p>With the report of the Secretary of the Navy will be
submitted, in conformity to the act of Congress of 3d March,
1827, for the gradual improvement of the Navy of the United
States, statements of the expenditures under that act and of the
measures taken for carrying the same into effect. Every section
of that statute contains a distinct provision looking to the
great object of the whole-the gradual improvement of the Navy.
Under its salutary sanction stores of ship timber have been
procured and are in process of seasoning and preservation for the
future uses of the Navy. Arrangements have been made for the
preservation of the live-oak timber growing on the lands of the
United States, and for its reproduction, to supply at future and
distant days the waste of that most valuable material for
shipbuilding by the great consumption of it yearly for the
commercial as well as for the military marine of our country. The
construction of the two dry docks at Charlestown and at Norfolk
is making satisfactory progress toward a durable establishment.
The examinations and inquiries to ascertain the practicability
and expediency of a marine railway at Pensacola, though not yet
accomplished, have been postponed but to be more effectually
made. The navy-yards of the United States have been examined, and
plans for their improvement and the preservation of the public
property therein at Portsmouth, Charlestown, Philadelphia,
Washington, and Gosport, and to which two others are to be added,
have been prepared and received my sanction; and no other portion
of my public duties has been performed with a more intimate
conviction of its importance to the future welfare and security
of the Union.</p>
<p>With the report from the Postmaster-General is exhibited a
comparative view of the gradual increase of that establishment,
from five to five years, since 1792 till this time in the number
of post-offices, which has grown from less than 200 to nearly
8,000; in the revenue yielded by them, which from $67,000 has
swollen to upward of a million and a half, and in the number of
miles of post-roads, which from 5,642 have multiplied to 114,536.
While in the same period of time the population of the Union has
about thrice doubled, the rate of increase of these offices is
nearly 40, and of the revenue and of traveled miles from 20 to 25
for 1. The increase of revenue within the last five years has
been nearly equal to the whole revenue of the Department in
1812.</p>
<p>The expenditures of the Department during the year which ended
on the 1st of July last have exceeded the receipts by a sum of
about $25,000. The excess has been occasioned by the increase of
mail conveyances and facilities to the extent of hear 800,000
miles. It has been supplied by collections from the postmasters
of the arrearages of preceding years. While the correct principle
seems to be that the income levied by the Department should
defray all its expenses, it has never been the policy of this
Government to raise from this establishment any revenue to be
applied to any other purposes. The suggestion of the
Postmaster-General that the insurance of the safe transmission of
moneys by the mail might be assumed by the Department for a
moderate and competent remuneration will deserve the
consideration of Congress.</p>
<p>A report from the commissioner of the public buildings in this
city exhibits the expenditures upon them in the course of the
current year. It will be seen that the humane and benevolent
intentions of Congress in providing, by the act of 20th May,
1826, for the erection of a penitentiary in this district have
been accomplished. The authority of further legislation is now
required for the removal to this tenement of the offenders
against the laws sentenced to atone by personal confinement for
their crimes, and to provide a code for their employment and
government while thus confined.</p>
<p>The commissioners appointed, conformably to the act of 2d
March, 1827, to provide for the adjustment of claims of persons
entitled to indemnification under the first article of the treaty
of Ghent, and for the distribution among such claimants of the
sum paid by the Government of Great Britain under the convention
of 13th of November, 1826, closed their labors on the 30th of
August last by awarding to the claimants the sum of
$1,197,422.18, leaving a balance of $7,537.82, which was
distributed ratably amongst all the claimants to whom awards had
been made, according to the directions of the act.</p>
<p>The exhibits appended to the report from the Commissioner of
the General Land Office present the actual condition of that
common property of the Union. The amount paid into the Treasury
from the proceeds of lands during the year 1827 and the first
half of 1828 falls little short of $2,000,000. The propriety of
further extending the time for the extinguishment of the debt due
to the United States by the purchasers of the public lands,
limited by the act of 21st March last to the 4th of July next,
will claim the consideration of Congress, to whose vigilance and
careful attention the regulation, disposal, and preservation of
this great national inheritance has by the people of the United
States been intrusted.</p>
<p>Among the important subjects to which the attention of the
present Congress has already been invited, and which may occupy
their further and deliberate discussion, will be the provision to
be made for taking the fifth census or enumeration of the
inhabitants of the United States. The Constitution of the United
States requires that this enumeration should be made within every
term of ten years, and the date from which the last enumeration
commenced was the first Monday of August of the year 1820. The
laws under which the former enumerations were taken were enacted
at the session of Congress immediately preceding the operation;
but considerable inconveniences were experienced from the delay
of legislation to so late a period. That law, like those of the
preceding enumerations, directed that the census should be taken
by the marshals of the several districts and Territories of the
Union under instructions from the Secretary of State. The
preparation and transmission to the marshals of those
instructions required more time than was then allowed between the
passage of the law and the day when the enumeration was to
commence. The term of six months limited for the returns of the
marshals was also found even then too short, and must be more so
now, when an additional population of at least 3,000,000 must be
presented upon the returns. As they are to be made at the short
session of Congress, it would, as well as from other
considerations, be more convenient to commence the enumeration
from an earlier period of the year than the 1st of August. The
most favorable season would be the spring. On a review of the
former enumerations it will be found that the plan for taking
every census has contained many improvements upon that of its
predecessor. The last is still susceptible of much improvement.
The Third Census was the first at which any account was taken of
the manufactures of the country. It was repeated at the last
enumeration, but the returns in both cases were necessarily very
imperfect. They must always be so, resting, of course, only upon
the communications voluntarily made by individuals interested in
some of the manufacturing establishments. Yet they contained much
valuable information, and may by some supplementary provision of
the law be rendered more effective. The columns of age,
commencing from infancy, have hitherto been confined to a few
periods, all under the number of 45 years. Important knowledge
would be obtained by extending these columns, in intervals of ten
years, to the utmost boundaries of human life. The labor of
taking them would be a trifling addition to that already
prescribed, and the result would exhibit comparative tables of
longevity highly interesting to the country. I deem it my duty
further to observe that much of the imperfections in the returns
of the last and perhaps of preceding enumerations proceeded from
the inadequateness of the compensations allowed to the marshals
and their assistants in taking them.</p>
<p>In closing this communication it only remains for me to assure
the Legislature of my continued earnest wish for the adoption of
measures recommended by me heretofore and yet to be acted on by
them, and of the cordial concurrence on my part in every
constitutional provision which may receive their sanction during
the session tending to the general welfare.</p>

States</i>:</p>
<p>By the act of Congress of the 23d of May last, "supplementary
to the several acts providing for the settlement and confirmation
of private land claims in Florida," provision was made for the
final adjudication of such claims by the judges of the superior
courts of the districts wherein the lands claimed respectively
lie, and by appeal from them to the Supreme Court of the United
States; and the attorneys of the United States in the several
districts were charged with the duty, in every case where the
decision should be against the United States by the judge of the
superior court of the district, to make out and transmit to the
Attorney-General of the United States a statement containing the
facts of the case and the points of law on which the same was
decided, and it was made the duty of the Attorney-General in most
of those cases to direct an appeal to be made to the Supreme
Court of the United States and to appear for the United States
and prosecute such appeals. By the same act the President of the
United States was authorized to appoint a law agent to
superintend the interests of the United States in the premises,
and to employ assistant counsel if in his opinion the public
interest should require the same.</p>
<p>In the process of carrying into execution this law it was the
opinion of the Attorney-General of the United States that a
translated complete collection of all the Spanish and French
ordinances, etc., affecting the land titles in Florida and the
other territories heretofore belonging to France and Spain, would
be indispensable to a just decision of those claims by the
Supreme Court. At his suggestion the task of preparing this
compilation was undertaken by Joseph M. White, of Florida, who
was employed as assistant counsel in behalf of the United States.
The collection has accordingly been made and is deposited in
manuscript at the Department of State, subject to such order as
Congress may see fit to take concerning it. The letter from Mr.
White to the Secretary of State, with a descriptive list of the
documents collected and thus deposited, is herewith transmitted

<p>By the act of Congress of the 3d March, 1826, for the survey
of a route for a canal between the Atlantic and the Gulf of
Mexico, the President of the United States was authorized to
cause to be made an accurate and minute examination of the
country south of the St. Marys River, and including the same,
with a view to ascertain the most eligible route for a canal
admitting the transit of boats to connect the Atlantic with the
Gulf of Mexico, and also with a view to ascertain the
practicability of a ship channel; that he cause particularly to
be examined the route to the Appalachicola River or Bay, with a
view to both the above objects; that he cause the necessary
surveys, both by land and along the coast, with estimates of the
expense of each, accompanied with proper plans, notes,
observations, explanations, and opinions of the Board of
Engineers, and that he cause a full report of these proceedings
to be made to Congress.</p>
<p>In execution of this law I transmit herewith a report from the

in my possession as to the practical operation of the recent act
of the British Parliament entitled "The customs amendment act,"
purporting a discrimination of duties upon the importation of
cotton from the British North American colonies and showing how
far this discrimination may affect existing treaties, I transmit
herewith a report from the Secretary of State, with copies of the
instructions and correspondence of the minister of the United
States at London, containing the information requested.</p>
<p>John Quincy Adams.</p>
<p><br>
 Washington,<br>
 <i>March 3, 1829</i>.</p>
<p><i>To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States</i>:</p>
<p>I transmit herewith to Congress a copy of the instructions
prepared by the Secretary of State and furnished to the ministers
of the United States appointed to attend at the assembly of
American plenipotentiaries first held at Panama and thence
transferred to Tacubaya. The occasion upon which they were given
has passed away, and there is no present probability of the
renewal of the negotiations; but the purposes for which they were
intended are still of the deepest interest to our country and to
the world, and may hereafter call again for the active efforts
and beneficent energies of the Government of the United States.
The motives for withholding them from general publication having
ceased, justice to the Government from which they emanated and to
the people for whose benefit it was instituted requires that they
should be made known. With this view, and from the consideration
that the subjects embraced by these instructions must probably
engage hereafter the deliberations of our successors, I deem it
proper to make this communication to both Houses of Congress. One
copy only of the instructions being prepared, I send it to the
Senate, requesting that it may be transmitted to the House of
Representatives.</p>
<p>John Quincy Adams.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
